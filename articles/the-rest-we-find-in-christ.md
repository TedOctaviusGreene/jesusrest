## The Rest We Find in Christ

From the very beginning, God set apart the Sabbath as a picture of His rest.

But the old covenant command to stop working was only a shadow — pointing us to something greater.

In Jesus, we no longer strive for righteousness by our own effort.

We **rest** in what He has finished on the cross.

> *“There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.”*  
> (Hebrews 4:9–10)

This is the true rest of the new covenant: not a single day, but a new life in Christ.
