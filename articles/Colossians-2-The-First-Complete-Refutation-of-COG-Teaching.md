# Colossians 2:16–17 — The First Complete Refutation of COG Teaching

# Shadows and the Substance of Christ  

Few verses cut more directly to the heart of the Sabbath and holy day debate than Colossians 2:16–17:  

> *“So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.”* (Col 2:16–17, NKJV)  

What did Paul mean? Did he cancel God’s law? Did he only set aside human traditions? Or was he showing that Christ Himself is the reality behind the calendar shadows? Let’s walk through this line upon line.

## The Warning Against Judgment  

Paul begins: *“So let no one judge you…”* (v.16). The Greek phrase is Μὴ οὖν τις ὑμᾶς κρινέτω—literally, “Therefore let no one act as your judge.” This is not permission for the church to police behavior; it is a command against anyone doing so.  

The context of Colossians 2 is key. Paul is warning against *“philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men”* (v.8) and against those who promote *“self-imposed religion, false humility, and neglect of the body”* (v.23). The danger was not lawlessness, but judgmentalism and man-made rules.  

So Paul says: don’t let anyone sit in judgment of you regarding food, drink, or sacred times.

## The Calendar Triad  

Notice the list:  

- *Festival* (ἑορτή, heortē) — the annual feast days  
- *New moon* (νουμηνία, noumēnia) — the monthly observances  
- *Sabbaths* (σάββατα, sabbata) — the weekly seventh day  

This “yearly, monthly, weekly” pattern is a standard Jewish summary of the covenant calendar (cf. 1 Chron 23:31; 2 Chron 2:4; Hos 2:11). Paul does not single one part out—he treats the whole system together.  

If the annual feasts are shadows, then so are the Sabbaths. If the Sabbaths remain binding, then so do the feasts. You cannot divide what Scripture has tied together.

## Shadows and Substance  

Paul explains: *“which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance [σῶμα, sōma] is of Christ.”*  

The word “shadow” (σκιά, skia) means an outline, a dim preview, not the real thing. The word “substance” (sōma) means “body” or “reality.” Together, they form a contrast: picture versus person, outline versus reality.  

Hebrews 10:1 uses the exact same language: *“For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things…”* The sacrifices, priesthood, and holy days were sketches pointing forward. The reality is Christ Himself.  

Once the person has come, the picture is no longer the focus.

## Paul’s Broader Teaching  

This is consistent with everything else Paul wrote:  

- *“One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind.”* (Rom 14:5)  
- *“But now after you have known God… how is it that you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements… You observe days and months and seasons and years. I am afraid for you.”* (Gal 4:9–11)  
- *“Christ is the end [goal] of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.”* (Rom 10:4)  

Paul never tells Gentile believers to adopt Israel’s calendar. Instead, he warns them not to become enslaved by it, nor judged by others who insist upon it.

## The Human Tendency to Add Works  

Why does this matter? Because human nature craves control. We want to point to something visible—rituals, days, foods—as proof of our righteousness. But Paul insists our righteousness is not in the shadow but in the substance.  

The COG error is to say we must “qualify” by obedience, by Sabbath-keeping, by clinging to the shadow. But the gospel says: *“He has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light.”* (Col 1:12).  

It is God, not our works, who qualifies us.

## Conclusion: The Reality Has Come  

Colossians 2:16–17 could not be clearer: the covenant calendar—festivals, new moons, Sabbaths—were shadows. The reality is Christ. To cling to the shadow as the requirement of salvation is to miss the substance.  

Does this mean Christians cannot enjoy a Sabbath rest or celebrate the festivals? Not at all. These can be beautiful reminders. But they are no longer covenant obligations, no longer signs of belonging.  

The true sign is faith in Christ, sealed by the Spirit. The true rest is not a day on the calendar but a Person who said: *“Come to Me… and I will give you rest.”* (Matt 11:28).  

So let no one judge you. The shadows are gone and the clear reality emerges. That reality is Christ. And in Him, you are complete. (Col 2:10).
