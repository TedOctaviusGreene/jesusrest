# From Eden’s Tree to Calvary’s Tree

## How the Covenants Pointed to Christ

From the very beginning, the story of God’s covenants was marked by trees. In Eden stood two trees—one that promised life, the other that carried the curse of death. Centuries later, Abraham split the wood of covenant sacrifice, and God Himself passed between the pieces. And at last, on Calvary’s tree, the Son of God bore the curse for us all.  

These are not disconnected images, but living symbols that tell one story: every covenant was pointing toward Christ.  

As we turn now to examine the covenants, we will see that what began with trees in Eden continues all the way to the tree of the cross.

In English we have no word quite like *covenant*. It is not a casual promise, nor a mere contract. A covenant is a life-binding pledge, an intimate union sealed by promise—and often by blood. Break it, and you invite the curse. Keep it, and you inherit the blessing. The living God, who is faithful and holy, would have nothing less in His dealings with man.  

This is why the Bible’s storyline is not a jumble of sayings. It is a sequence of covenants, each carrying the plot of redemption forward. And the New Testament insists that much of what God gave Israel was shadow—true, God-given pointers—but not the final reality.  

> **“So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.”**  
> *(Colossians 2:16–17, NKJV)*  

Hebrews echoes the same:  

> **“They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven.”**  
> *(Hebrews 8:5, NKJV)*  

> **“For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with these same sacrifices, which they offer continually year by year, make those who approach perfect.”**  
> *(Hebrews 10:1, NKJV)*  

Think of foreshadowing in film. In *The Matrix*, early on Neo is told he feels something is wrong with the world—that “like a splinter in your mind.” Only later, when he awakens to reality, does that shadowed hint explode with meaning. The old covenant worked the same way. Its sabbaths, festivals, priesthood, and sacrifices were cinematic whispers of a greater reality: Christ Himself.  

So let us walk through the storyline—Egypt, Sinai, David, Abraham, the Cross, and the New Covenant—seeing how the shadows always pointed forward and how the substance has come in Christ.

## Egypt: The Shadow of Sin’s Slavery  

Israel begins in chains. Their slavery under Pharaoh was bitter, physical, and unrelenting. The Lord Himself branded Egypt “the house of bondage” so that lesson would never be forgotten:  

> **“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.”**  
> *(Exodus 20:2, NKJV)*  

Pharaoh’s tyranny—work without rest, quotas without mercy—was not just history. It foreshadowed the deeper slavery of the human heart. Jesus said it plainly:  

> **“Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin. And a slave does not abide in the house forever, but a son abides forever. Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.”**  
> *(John 8:34–36, NKJV)*  

God freed Israel from Pharaoh’s yoke, but freedom from Egypt was not freedom from sin. What came next at Sinai would teach Israel—and us—that true liberty had not yet arrived.

## Sinai: The Shadow of Condemnation  

At Sinai the mountain shook, fire burned, and the Lord spoke His covenant words. Israel pledged, “All that the LORD has spoken we will do” *(Exodus 19:8, NKJV)*—but broke their vow before Moses even returned with the tablets.  

The apostles look back and describe Sinai with sober clarity:  

> **“These are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar—for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.”**  
> *(Galatians 4:24–25, NKJV)*  

Peter pressed the same truth at the Jerusalem council:  

> **“Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?”**  
> *(Acts 15:10, NKJV)*  

Paul calls it *“the ministry of death”* and *“the ministry of condemnation”* (2 Corinthians 3:7–9, NKJV), not because God’s law was evil—it is holy, just, and good *(Romans 7:12, NKJV)*—but because it demanded righteousness and gave no power to produce it. Sinai was a mirror, not a cure. A shadow, not the substance.  

Yet even under that yoke of shadow, God gave His people glimpses of something brighter. One man’s songs pierced the smoke of sacrifice and hinted at realities Sinai could never give.

## David: A Glimpse Beyond Shadows  

David, Israel’s poet-king, sang of things deeper than ritual. While priests labored in endless cycles of sacrifice, David looked beyond lambs and incense to the heart of God.  

> **“Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man to whom the LORD does not impute iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.”**  
> *(Psalm 32:1–2, NKJV)*  

> **“Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me away from Your presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me by Your generous Spirit.”**  
> *(Psalm 51:10–12, NKJV)*  

> **“The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart—these, O God, You will not despise.”**  
> *(Psalm 51:17, NKJV)*  

These cries reach far past ritual. David’s harp anticipated the Lamb who would bear sin, the Spirit who would renew hearts, the forgiveness Sinai could never give. He lived under the shadow, but he tasted the dawn.  

But how could David glimpse realities that Sinai could not provide? To answer that, we must step further back—to a night when God Himself walked between pieces of slain animals and swore by His own life.

## Abraham: Faith, Promise, and Works of Obedience  

Genesis 15 records a covenant unlike any other. Animals were cut in two, a path made between the pieces. In that culture both parties would walk the path, saying, “May I be as these if I break my word.” But Abraham did not walk. God alone passed through:  

> **“And it came to pass, when the sun went down and it was dark, that behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a burning torch that passed between those pieces. On the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram.”**  
> *(Genesis 15:17–18, NKJV)*  

By this act God bound Himself to bear the covenant curse. The cross was already foreshadowed.  

Abraham’s standing before God is summed in one verse:  

> **“And he believed in the LORD, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.”**  
> *(Genesis 15:6, NKJV)*  

Paul seizes on this in Romans:  

> **“For what does the Scripture say? ‘Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.’ Now to him who works, the wages are not counted as grace but as debt.”**  
> *(Romans 4:3–4, NKJV)*  

And in Galatians:  

> **“And this I say, that the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect.”**  
> *(Galatians 3:17, NKJV)*  

Then comes Paul’s decisive line:  

> **“Yet the law is not of faith, but ‘the man who does them shall live by them.’”**  
> *(Galatians 3:12, NKJV)*  

Here lies the key contrast. Sinai says, *“Do and live.”* Abraham’s covenant says, *“Believe and be credited righteous.”* They cannot be blended.  

Abraham’s life proves it. Twice he lied about Sarah, calling her his sister *(Genesis 12:13; 20:2)*. He doubted and fathered Ishmael through Hagar *(Genesis 16:2–4)*. Yet none of this annulled the covenant or erased his credited righteousness. His failures never stopped God’s promise.  

Sinai worked the opposite way. Break the Sabbath, defile the holy things, or transgress one commandment, and the covenant invoked the curse. Its blessings were temporary—food, peace, land. But never righteousness. Abraham’s covenant was faith and promise. Sinai’s was law and curse.  

If Abraham’s covenant secured righteousness and Sinai’s could not, how would the story move forward? God’s oath was still hanging in the air. Somewhere, somehow, the curse had to fall—and the promise had to be kept.

## The Story Written in Trees  

The Bible often uses trees as living symbols in the unfolding of God’s covenants. In Eden, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil stood as a visible covenant test. God warned:  

**“Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”** (Genesis 2:16–17)  

Humanity chose wrongly, and the curse of death entered the world.  

With Abraham, covenant symbols shifted to cut animals and burning fire, yet the image still leaned on wood and blood. Abraham even *“took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son”* (Genesis 22:6), foreshadowing the wood of the cross.  

Finally, Paul connects Christ’s cross directly to this story of trees:  

**“Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree’).”** (Galatians 3:13)  

The cross was no accident of Roman execution. It was the ordained tree where curse would be borne, and life restored. From Eden’s loss to Abraham’s faith to Calvary’s redemption, the “tree” theme ties the covenants together. What humanity lost by reaching for the wrong tree, Christ regained by bearing the curse on the tree.  

And so the line of covenants—Eden, Abraham, Sinai—was not random. Each one, like branches on a tree, stretched toward the day when Christ would come as the substance. Let us now move forward from Abraham to Sinai’s shadows, and then beyond, to see how all the covenants converge in Him.


## From Oath to Cross: When the Shadow Met the Substance  

Centuries after Abraham, Daniel foresaw the moment when the covenant oath would be paid:  

> **“And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself.”**  
> *(Daniel 9:26, NKJV)*  

At Calvary the God who walked the blood-path bore the covenant curse. Darkness covered the land. The Son hung forsaken between heaven and earth. Paul declares:  

> **“Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree’), that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.”**  
> *(Galatians 3:13–14, NKJV)*  

The shadow gave way to the substance. Christ is the Passover Lamb *(1 Corinthians 5:7)*. He is the Temple *(John 2:19–21)*. He is the High Priest *(Hebrews 7:23–25)*. He is the Son of David whose throne is forever *(Luke 1:32–33)*. What the law could only show, Christ accomplished.  

But Calvary was not the start of something random. It was the climax of a story of covenants, each one laying a brick in the road that led to the cross and beyond. To see this, we must step back and survey them all.

## God’s Covenants in Order  

The Bible unfolds as a series of covenants, each one pointing beyond itself.  

**Adam / Creation**: Though the word “covenant” is not used, Hosea 6:7 hints at one. Adam was placed under a command with blessing for obedience and death for disobedience *(Genesis 2:15–17)*. Christ comes as the last Adam to undo his failure *(Romans 5:18–19; 1 Corinthians 15:45)*.  

**Noah**: God promised never again to destroy the earth by flood, setting the rainbow as the sign *(Genesis 9:12–17)*. This covenant preserves creation itself so that redemption history could unfold.  

**Abraham**: Promise of land, nation, and blessing to all families *(Genesis 12:1–3)*. Ratified by God’s oath *(Genesis 15:17–18)*. Justification by faith, not works of law *(Genesis 15:6; Romans 4:3)*.  

**Sinai (Moses)**: Law given with conditions *(Exodus 19:5)*. Sign: Sabbath *(Exodus 31:16–17)*. Described as bondage *(Galatians 4:24)*, yoke *(Acts 15:10)*, and ministry of death *(2 Corinthians 3:7)*. It was temporary, a tutor pointing to Christ *(Galatians 3:24)*.  

**Priestly (Levi / Phinehas)**: A covenant of priesthood to guard holiness *(Numbers 25:12–13; Malachi 2:4–5)*. Fulfilled in Christ, the eternal High Priest *(Hebrews 7:23–25)*.  

**Davidic**: Promise of a throne forever *(2 Samuel 7:12–16; Psalm 89:34–36)*. Fulfilled in Christ, Son of David, whose kingdom never ends *(Luke 1:32–33)*.  

**New Covenant**: Promised in Jeremiah 31:31–34, inaugurated in Christ’s blood *(Luke 22:20)*. Features: forgiveness of sins, law written on hearts, Spirit given, access to God’s presence *(Hebrews 8:10–12; Hebrews 10:19–22)*.  

Each covenant builds the case: Adam failed, Noah preserved, Abraham promised, Sinai condemned, David pointed forward. Only the New Covenant brings the substance.

## The Win-Win of the Old Covenant  

Why would God give a covenant He knew Israel could not keep? To magnify both our need and His grace.  

Sinai demanded obedience and exposed disobedience. It condemned. But Christ bore the condemnation. It demanded death. Christ died the death it required. It exposed our need. Christ became the answer.  

So the old covenant collapses not in defeat but in fulfillment. It did its work as a tutor, leading us to Christ. In Him its curse turned into a servant of grace.

## Conclusion: Enter His Rest  

The shadows have done their work. The substance has come. From Egypt’s chains to Sinai’s tutor to Calvary’s cross, God’s storyline has always been moving here.  

> **“Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.”**  
> *(John 8:36, NKJV)*  

> **“Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.”**  
> *(Galatians 5:1, NKJV)*  

> **“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me… For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”**  
> *(Matthew 11:28–30, NKJV)*  

> **“There remains therefore a rest for the people of God… let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest.”**  
> *(Hebrews 4:9,11, NKJV)*  

The story of God’s covenants does not end in bondage, failure, or shadow. It ends where it was always meant to—in Christ, the true substance. Here forgiveness is real, hearts are made new, and rest is finally given. In Him the covenant curse has been borne, the covenant promise has been secured, and the covenant rest has been opened. The shadows have passed. The substance is here. And so the story comes full circle. In Eden, the tree became a place of curse and exile. At Sinai, covenant obligations loomed heavy like a forest of commands. But at Calvary, the tree became the place of redemption—where curse was lifted, covenant was kept, and life was given.  

In Christ, the shadows have done their work, and the substance has come. The tree that once condemned now saves, and the covenant of rest is open to all who believe.
