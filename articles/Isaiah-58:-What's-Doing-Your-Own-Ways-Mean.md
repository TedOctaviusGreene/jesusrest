# “Doing Your Own Ways” — Isaiah 58, the Sabbath, and the Freedom of the Gospel  

The Churches of God love to quote Isaiah 58:13–14 as their strongest proof that the Sabbath must be guarded by strict rules. They insist this passage forbids working, talking about your job, or even enjoying what they call “your own pleasure.” To them, Sabbath is about *not doing.*  

But what if the passage doesn’t say what they think? What if Isaiah’s words, in their Hebrew meaning, show something very different? And what if the New Covenant in Christ takes us even further — into a Sabbath rest where there is no prohibition of work at all?  

Let’s take a careful look.

## 1. Isaiah’s Call: Stop “Doing Your Own Ways”  

Here is the text itself:  

> *“If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath,  
> From doing your own ways on My holy day,  
> And call the Sabbath a delight,  
> The holy day of the LORD honorable,  
> And shall honor Him, not doing your own ways,  
> Nor finding your own pleasure,  
> Nor speaking your own words,  
> Then you shall delight yourself in the LORD;  
> And I will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth,  
> And feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father.  
> The mouth of the LORD has spoken.”* (Isaiah 58:13–14 NKJV)  

At first glance, it looks like a list of prohibitions: don’t do your ways, don’t find your pleasure, don’t speak your words. But the Hebrew text tells a different story.  

- **“Doing your own ways”** — The word *derek* (“way”) often means your *customary business, your ordinary undertakings.* To “do your ways” means to keep running your commerce, your affairs, your money-making.  
- **“Finding your own pleasure”** — The word *ḥēp̱eṣ* can mean pleasure, but it also means *business, occupation, affairs.* In Ecclesiastes 3:1 it is translated “purpose,” not “pleasure.” Isaiah isn’t banning joy; he’s banning *business-as-usual.*  
- **“Speaking your own words”** — The Hebrew *dāḇār* doesn’t just mean “word.” It often means *matter, affair, business report.* So this phrase literally means “stop talking business.”  

Put together, the message is this: *On the Sabbath, stop treating the day like any other business day.* Stop running commerce. Stop making deals. Stop oppressing your workers by forcing them into the winepress, as Nehemiah 13 describes.  

Isaiah is not forbidding fun, joy, or ordinary conversation. He is condemning those who turned Sabbath into a day of profit.

## 2. The Delight of the Sabbath  

The Hebrew word for “delight” here is *oneg* — meaning “exquisite delight, luxury, dainty, sweet.” God wanted Sabbath to be the most joyful, refreshing, happy day of the week.  

The Churches of God have turned Isaiah’s invitation into a chain of rules. But Isaiah’s point is the opposite: the Sabbath was meant to be a feast of joy.  

Can you imagine Jesus laughing with His disciples on the Sabbath? Healing the sick? Telling stories? Of course. Because Sabbath was for *life-giving delight,* not ritual misery.

## 3. The Old Covenant Sabbath  

Still, we must remember: under the old covenant, the Sabbath law was part of the covenant written on stone:  

> *“So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone.”* (Deut 4:13)  

Breaking that covenant was serious. A man gathering sticks was executed (Num 15:32–36). Commerce on Sabbath was a national sin (Neh 13:15–18).  

Why so strict? Because the Sabbath, as law, belonged to the covenant of stone. And that covenant was indivisible.

## 4. The Covenant That Ended  

Paul tells us plainly:  

> *“If the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious … what is passing away was glorious, what remains is much more glorious.”* (2 Cor 3:7–11)  

The covenant written on stone was glorious — but it was temporary. It passed away.  

And with it passed away the legal enforcement of the Sabbath, the prohibition of labor, the penalty of death.

## 5. The Shadow and the Reality  

Paul writes to the Colossians:  

> *“So let no one judge you … regarding a festival or a new moon or Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.”* (Col 2:16–17)  

Here he sweeps up the whole calendar — yearly festivals, monthly new moons, weekly Sabbaths. All of it was shadow. The body, the reality, is Christ.  

To keep enforcing Sabbath law today is to cling to a shadow after the substance has arrived.

## 6. The Rest That Remains  

The writer of Hebrews declares:  

> *“There remains therefore a rest [sabbatismos] for the people of God. For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.”* (Heb 4:9–10)  

Notice: it doesn’t say “there remains a prohibition.” It says there remains a *rest.*  

And Jesus gives the invitation:  

> *“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest … you will find rest for your souls.”* (Matt 11:28–29)  

This is the New Covenant Sabbath: ceasing from our works and entering Christ’s finished work.

## 7. What This Means for You Today  

Now we must press the point home. If the Sabbath law was nailed to the cross (Col 2:14–17), then the prohibition against work, commerce, and speech is no longer binding.  

- If you want to rest on Saturday, rest.  
- If you need to work, work.  
- If you want to laugh, talk, and enjoy a meal with friends, do so.  
- If you want to play a ballgame, play.  

You are free. The old covenant prohibition has ended.  

The Sabbath still exists — not as a rule to police, but as a rest to enjoy. You can keep a weekly rhythm of rest if it refreshes you. You can call the Sabbath a delight. But you no longer need to fear that working or speaking “your own words” is sin.  

Because the real Sabbath is Christ.

## 8. The Lesson for the Churches of God  

The Churches of God have turned Isaiah 58 into a weapon of guilt. They forbid joy, forbid speech, forbid ordinary life. But they are reading the Hebrew backwards.  

Isaiah never condemned pleasure. He condemned business oppression. And Paul tells us the entire covenant of stone is obsolete.  

So the truth is this:  

- Isaiah meant the Sabbath to be joy, not burden.  
- The old covenant prohibition of labor has ended.  
- The new covenant Sabbath is found in Christ.  

Therefore, you are free to rest or to work. The Sabbath is not about what you *cannot* do. It is about who you *can* rest in.

## Conclusion: Rest, Without Fear  

Isaiah called God’s people to stop doing their own business and to delight in Him. That message still stands — but now the covenant has changed. The prohibition of labor is gone. The delight remains.  

So if you go to work on Saturday, you have not sinned. If you laugh with your children, you have not broken God’s law. If you rest, you do so not because you must, but because you may.  

The Sabbath is no longer a legal test. It is a gospel gift.  

And the gift is Christ Himself.  

*“Come to Me … and I will give you rest.”* (Matt 11:28)
