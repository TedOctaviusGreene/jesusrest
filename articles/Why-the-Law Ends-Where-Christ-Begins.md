# **Christ Alone — Why the Law Ends Where Christ Begins**  



The Scriptures declare that Jesus Christ is **the Author and the Finisher of our faith** (Hebrews 12:2). And yet many, having begun by the Spirit, are bewitched into trying to be perfected by the flesh (Galatians 3:1–3). They look to Sinai as if it were their ladder to God instead of the gallows on which the flesh is condemned. They speak of grace, yet measure themselves by the law. They profess Christ, yet trust performance. They claim to rest in Jesus, while walking on the treadmill of Sinai.

But Scripture will not allow this confusion to stand. It reveals a clarity that once seen cannot be unseen, and once believed sets the soul permanently free. Let us consider now one great theme divided into three great pillars:

## **The Testimony of David: The Law Cannot Save, Only God Saves**

Let us begin where few legalists expect us to begin: in the Psalms, with David—the greatest king of the Sinai era, the man after God’s own heart, living at the very center of the old covenant system.

If righteousness could come through the Sinai law, then David—a king with access to priests, sacrifices, feasts, commandments, and temple worship—should be the supreme example of achieving holiness through obedience. And yet David never once places his hope of salvation in law-keeping. Not once.

Instead he cries:

> **“The LORD is my light and my salvation.”** — Psalm 27:1  
> **“Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not impute.”** — Psalm 32:2  
> **“If You, LORD, should mark iniquities, who could stand?”** — Psalm 130:3  
> **“Do not enter into judgment with Your servant, for no one living is righteous before You.”** — Psalm 143:2

David—under the Sinai covenant—speaks like a man standing inside the New Covenant. He rests his hope entirely in **God’s mercy**, **God’s righteousness**, and **God’s salvation**, not in his own performance.

And the New Testament confirms this:  
Paul quotes David in Romans 4 as the example of justification **apart from works**:

> **“David describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from works.”** — Romans 4:6

And so we see plainly that David—the greatest king under the Sinai covenant, living in the very heart of the law system—never once appealed to his obedience, his sacrifices, his commandment-keeping, or his righteousness as the basis of his standing before God. Instead, he repeatedly confesses that **if God judged him by the law, he could not stand** (Psalm 143:2; Psalm 130:3). He declares that **forgiveness is based on God’s mercy, not man’s performance** (Psalm 51:1), and that **blessing belongs to the man whose sins are not imputed** (Psalm 32:1–2). And the apostle Paul, carried by the Holy Spirit, confirms that David’s testimony was not personal preference but **God’s eternal pattern of justification** (Romans 4:6–8).

**Therefore**, if David—the man after God’s own heart, anointed by the Spirit, reigning from Jerusalem itself—could not use the law for righteousness, neither can any man use it now. **The Psalms themselves prove that righteousness has always come from God’s mercy, never from human law-keeping.**

If David could not stand before God by the law, then who could?  
And if the law could not make righteous the best man under it, then **why did God give it at all?**  
To answer that, we must turn to the One who alone fulfilled it—and examine the difference between His nature and ours.

## **The Nature of Christ vs. the Nature of Man: Why Only He Could Fulfill the Law**

Legalism survives on one delusion—that because Jesus kept the law as a man, we can and must also keep it as a measure of righteousness. But the Scriptures tell a different story.

Jesus did not come in sinful flesh as we have it.  
He came **in the likeness** of sinful flesh (Romans 8:3). He was fully human, yet born holy:

> **“That Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.”** — Luke 1:35  
> **“In Him there is no sin.”** — 1 John 3:5  
> **“Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth.”** — 1 Peter 2:22  
> **“Tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin.”** — Hebrews 4:15

We, by contrast, were:
> **“brought forth in iniquity”** (Psalm 51:5),  
> born dead in sin (Ephesians 2:1),  
> **all under sin** (Romans 3:9),  
> **none righteous** (Romans 3:10),  
> **enemies of God** (Romans 5:10).

Christ kept the law **not to be our example**, but to be our **substitute**:

> **“Born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law.”** — Galatians 4:4–5

If Jesus kept the law merely to show that we could keep it too, then the cross is unnecessary.  
But Paul declares:

> **“If righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died in vain.”** — Galatians 2:21

The law was never given to improve the flesh—but to **condemn the flesh**:

> **“For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did…”** — Romans 8:3

Christ fulfilled the law **to end it**, not to set a standard for us to imitate or continue. **He alone was born holy** (Luke 1:35), **He alone was without sin** (1 Peter 2:22; 1 John 3:5), **He alone perfectly obeyed** (Hebrews 4:15), and **He alone stood outside Adam’s fallen nature** (1 Corinthians 15:47). That is why **He alone could be the spotless Lamb** required for the atonement of the world (Exodus 12:5; 1 Peter 1:19). And it is why Paul declares that **if righteousness could come through the law, then Christ died for no reason** (Galatians 2:21). If we could keep the law by the Spirit the way Jesus did, then the cross is not salvation—it is only inspiration.

**Therefore**, Christ did what **only the Holy One of God could do**—not so that we could repeat His work, but so that He could **replace the old covenant entirely** with His own finished work (Hebrews 10:9). And we now receive by **grace**, not performance, what **only His obedience could achieve** (Romans 5:19).

If this is true—if Christ fulfilled the law as a substitute and not as a model—then righteousness cannot now be found in human effort, even after receiving the Spirit. The question then becomes: **What has changed in us?** If we are new creations, yet still experience weakness, then what is the nature of the believer now, and how do we live?  
To answer that, we must understand **our nature in Christ**, and why the law can never again be our hope.

## **The New Creation: Why the Law Is Not for the Righteous and Why We Live by Abiding, Not Achievement**

When we believed, something miraculous happened:

> **“If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.”** — 2 Corinthians 5:17  
> **“We become the righteousness of God in Him.”** — 2 Corinthians 5:21  
> **“He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.”** — 1 Corinthians 6:17

But God did not renovate our flesh.  
He crucified it:

> **“Our old man was crucified with Him.”** — Romans 6:6  
> **“You have become dead to the law.”** — Romans 7:4  
> **“You are not under the law but under grace.”** — Romans 6:14  
> **“If you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.”** — Galatians 5:18

And here the Scripture speaks like thunder:

> **“The law is not made for a righteous person.”** — 1 Timothy 1:9

So the law is:
- For the ungodly,
- For the unregenerate,
- For the rebellious,
- For the unconverted.

But not for the righteous—and **you are the righteous**, because righteousness has been **imputed**, not earned (Romans 4:5–6).  
Therefore the law cannot serve as:
- your covenant,
- your standard,
- your identity,
- your measuring stick,
- or your sanctification method.

The Christian life is not performance but **abiding**:

> **“Abide in Me… for without Me you can do nothing.”** — John 15:4–5

And abiding is expressed as **walking in the Spirit**:

> **“Walk in the Spirit.”** — Galatians 5:16  
> **“If you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.”** — Galatians 5:18

Walking is not effort—it is **dependence in motion**.  
The fruit is not produced by striving, but by the Spirit:

> **“The fruit of the Spirit is love… against such things there is no law.”** — Galatians 5:22–23

And so we see: we are indeed **new creations** (2 Corinthians 5:17), but we remain housed in mortal bodies still marked by weakness, groaning for redemption (Romans 8:23). We carry **a new spirit** (1 Corinthians 6:17), but we still feel the pull of **the flesh** (Galatians 5:17). We are **fully justified** (Romans 5:1), yet not **fully glorified** (1 John 3:2). And because of this, God declares that **the law is not made for a righteous person** (1 Timothy 1:9). Why? Because **righteousness is now imputed, not achieved** (Romans 4:5–6). Because **we are no longer under the law, but under grace** (Romans 6:14). And because **the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made us free from the law of sin and death** (Romans 8:2).

In light of this, it becomes not only unnecessary but **theologically absurd** to return to the Sinai law as either a covenant or a measuring stick. To attempt to prove righteousness by commandment-keeping is to deny the completed work of Christ and to rebuild what God has destroyed (Galatians 2:18). The only life available to us now is **not performance**, but **abiding** (John 15:4), and the only righteousness we possess is **Christ Himself** (1 Corinthians 1:30).  

**Therefore**, our hope is not in how we walk, but in who walks in us. Our confidence is not in improving the flesh, but in the Spirit who produces fruit (Galatians 5:22–23). And our gaze is no longer fixed upon Sinai, but upon **Jesus, the Author and the Finisher of our faith** (Hebrews 12:2).

And thus, from David in the Psalms, through Christ in the Gospels, to Paul in the epistles, Scripture speaks with one voice: **The law ends where Christ begins.**  
And the Christian life is not achieved by strengthening the flesh, but by **abiding in the One who fulfilled the law for us.**

Amen.
