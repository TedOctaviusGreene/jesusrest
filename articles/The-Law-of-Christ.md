# The Law of Christ: Commandments That Are Not Burdensome

John wrote, *“For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome.”* (1 John 5:3)  

But Paul called the covenant at Sinai *bondage* (Galatians 4:24–25). Peter called it a *yoke which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear* (Acts 15:10).  

So which is it? Are God’s commandments a light and joyful burden, or are they an unbearable yoke? The answer reveals the very heart of the New Covenant.

## The Old Covenant: A Burdensome Yoke

Let us be clear: the Bible itself calls the covenant at Sinai **bondage**.  

- *“The one from Mount Sinai… gives birth to bondage.”* (Galatians 4:24)  
- *“Why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?”* (Acts 15:10)  

The law at Sinai was holy, just, and good (Romans 7:12). But its effect on sinful man was slavery. It demanded righteousness but gave no power to produce it. It exposed sin but could not heal it.  

Every Sabbath command broken, every feast neglected, every unclean food eaten, every tithe withheld — all brought condemnation. Instead of life, it ministered death:  
*“The ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious… For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, the ministry of righteousness exceeds much more in glory.”* (2 Corinthians 3:7–9)

This is the bomb Paul drops: the covenant carved in stone was the ministry of death. That is why it was bondage.

## The New Covenant: The Law of Christ

But John’s words are no less true: *“His commandments are not burdensome.”* How? Because he was not speaking of Sinai’s law, but of Christ’s.  

Jesus gave His disciples a new commandment:  
*“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.”* (John 13:34)  

This is the law of Christ — love expressed in action. Paul says:  
*“Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.”* (Galatians 6:2)  

And James calls it the perfect law of liberty:  
*“He who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it… this one will be blessed in what he does.”* (James 1:25)

## Why These Commandments Are Not Burdensome

Why is the law of Christ not burdensome? Because it is **Spirit-powered**.  

Paul writes:  
*“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.”* (Romans 8:2)  

The old covenant was written on stone, outside of man. It commanded but could not enable. The new covenant is written on the heart by the Spirit:  
*“I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts.”* (Hebrews 8:10)  

When love is written on the heart, obedience is no longer slavery — it is joy. Love fulfills the law:  
*“Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.”* (Romans 13:10)

## Christ’s Easy Yoke

Jesus Himself declared the difference:  
*“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me… For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”* (Matthew 11:28–30)  

The law of Moses was a heavy yoke — hundreds of rules, sacrifices, and shadows. But the law of Christ is a light yoke, because it is love, empowered by the Spirit.  

The Spirit does what the law could never do:  
*“What the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son… that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.”* (Romans 8:3–4)

## Exhortation

Beloved, do not confuse the two. The covenant at Sinai was bondage, a ministry of death, a yoke too heavy to bear. But the law of Christ is liberty, life, and love.  

> Ritual law was slavery. Love is freedom. Stone tablets condemned. The Spirit gives life.  

And so John’s words ring true: *“His commandments are not burdensome.”* Not because Sinai’s yoke was light, but because Christ’s Spirit now empowers love within us.
