# Faith Alone Saves

We are saved by grace through faith alone in Christ Jesus.  
Not by works, so that no one can boast.  
Our life of obedience is the fruit of salvation, not the root.  

**Key Verse:**  
> "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God."  
> â€” Ephesians 2:8
