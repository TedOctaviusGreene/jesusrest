# The Danger of Putting Faith in Your Own Obedience  

Every human heart has the same tendency: we want to do something to prove ourselves. We want control. We want to clean ourselves up first, to make ourselves “good enough” before coming to God. But the gospel is the exact opposite—God pursues us before we ever lift a hand.

## The Santa Claus Theory of Religion  

Many live by what could be called the “Santa Claus theory”: if you’re naughty you get punishment, if you’re nice you get reward. But that is not the gospel. That is law. If salvation were built on such a system, none of us would stand—*“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God”* (Rom 3:23).  

The truth is this: God does not sit with a checklist of naughty and nice deeds. He has already acted in love.  
- *“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”* (Rom 5:8)  

Notice—while we were still sinners. Not after we cleaned ourselves up. Not after we “qualified.” God made the first move.

## The False Security of Obedience  

The legalists (modern day Pharisees) often speak of “qualifying” for the Kingdom by obedience. But Scripture warns that putting trust in our obedience is deadly.  

- *“By the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.”* (Gal 2:16)  
- *“For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.’”* (Gal 3:10)  
- *“Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”* (Rom 3:20)  

The law shows our failure; it cannot be the ground of our confidence. To rest your faith in your obedience is to build your house on sand.

## Faith in Christ Alone  

The gospel calls us to faith in Christ, not in ourselves. Salvation is not Jesus plus our Sabbath-keeping, Jesus plus our tithing, Jesus plus our obedience. Salvation is Jesus alone.  

- *“Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us.”* (Titus 3:5)  
- *“Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law.”* (Rom 3:28)  
- *“For by grace you have been saved through faith… not of works, lest anyone should boast.”* (Eph 2:8–9)  

To trust in your works, even partly, is to rob Christ of His glory. To trust in His work alone is to enter rest.

## The Psychology of Control  

Why is it so hard for us to believe this? Because our human nature craves control. We would rather point to something we did than admit total dependence. Religion often feeds this—urging people to clean themselves up first, to prove they are worthy. But Jesus tells the opposite story.  

He calls the weary and burdened, not the qualified:  
- *“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”* (Matt 11:28)  

He is the one who washes us clean:  
- *“Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.”* (Isa 1:18)

## The Real Danger of Trusting Your Own Obedience  

The danger is not just that trusting your own obedience “doesn’t work.” The danger is that it actually cuts you off from grace.  

God warned Israel from the very beginning:  

- *“And the LORD spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of the words, but saw no form; you only heard a voice. So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone.”* (Deut 4:12–13)  

Notice what God emphasized: Israel heard His **voice**, not His form. He gave them His covenant written on stone—but it was never meant to be the final word. The voice was greater than the tablets, because the tablets themselves pointed forward to Christ. To cling to those rituals now that the greater Word has come is to miss the very thing God was preparing His people for.  

Paul confirms this in 2 Corinthians 3. He calls the covenant written on stone—*“the ministry of death, engraved in letters on stone”* (v.7)—something glorious, yes, but also something that was **passing away** (v.11). To put confidence in the old covenant after Christ has fulfilled it is to cling to what brings death instead of life.  

That is why Paul warns the Galatians so sharply:  

- *“You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.”* (Gal 5:4)  

Fallen from grace! The danger is not minor. To insist on obedience to the old covenant as the ground of salvation is to sever yourself from Christ’s finished work.

## Why God Designed It This Way  

At first this may sound frightening. But it is actually good news. Why? Because if our standing with God depended on our obedience, we would never be secure. One failure would destroy us. The law itself says:  

- *“Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.”* (Gal 3:10)  

But God designed salvation differently. He made it about His love, not our performance. He counts us righteous in Christ, not because of what we do, but because of who we are in Him.  

- *“He has made us accepted in the Beloved.”* (Eph 1:6)  
- *“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”* (Gal 3:26)  

This is freedom! We are loved for who we are—children of God—not for how well we perform. Works then flow out of gratitude and love, not out of fear and striving.  

This is why Paul insists, *“Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.”* (Gal 5:1).  

To rest in Christ’s work is the only way to avoid falling from grace—and the only way to experience the joy of being loved, fully and freely, by God.

## Works: Fruit, Not Foundation  

Does this mean works are unimportant? No—works are the fruit of faith, not the foundation of salvation. The sinner who once tried to make himself “good” now rests in Jesus. Out of that rest, new works naturally flow.  

- *“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.”* (Eph 2:10)  

Notice the order: we are saved by grace, and then we walk in works God has prepared. Works confirm faith; they never purchase salvation.

## Conclusion: Trust the One Who Qualifies You  

The message is simple: God is not looking for your Sabbath ritual, your tithing record, or your obedience as payment. He is looking for your faith in His Son.  

- *“He has made us accepted in the Beloved.”* (Eph 1:6)  

Jesus alone qualifies you. His work alone makes you holy. His finished sacrifice alone secures your place in God’s family.  

So lay down the heavy burden of trying to prove yourself. Stop clutching at control. The door to salvation is not labeled *Qualified by Works* but *Justified by Faith*.  

And the moment you believe, you can rest—not in your own obedience, but in His.
