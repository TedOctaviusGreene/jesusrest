## Colossians 2 Explained: Did Paul Abolish the Sabbath and Holy Days?

Paul’s words in Colossians 2:16–17 are often used to defend keeping the Sabbath and Holy Days. But what did he really mean? This study shows how the Weekly and Annual Sabbaths foreshadow Christ; they show us the reality of what they promised, Him.

# Shadows and the Substance of Christ  

Few verses cut more directly to the heart of the Sabbath and holy day debate than Colossians 2:16–17:  

> *“So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.”* (Col 2:16–17, NKJV)  

What did Paul mean? Did he cancel God’s law? Did he only set aside human traditions? Or was he showing that Christ Himself is the reality behind the calendar shadows? Let’s walk through this line upon line.

## The Warning Against Judgment  

Paul begins: *“So let no one judge you…”* (v.16). The Greek phrase is Μὴ οὖν τις ὑμᾶς κρινέτω—literally, “Therefore let no one act as your judge.” This is not permission for the church to police behavior; it is a command against anyone doing so.  

The context of Colossians 2 is key. Paul is warning against *“philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men”* (v.8) and against those who promote *“self-imposed religion, false humility, and neglect of the body”* (v.23). The danger was not lawlessness, but judgmentalism and man-made rules.  

So Paul says: don’t let anyone sit in judgment of you regarding food, drink, or sacred times.

## The Calendar Triad  

Notice the list:  

- *Festival* (ἑορτή, heortē) — the annual feast days  
- *New moon* (νουμηνία, noumēnia) — the monthly observances  
- *Sabbaths* (σάββατα, sabbata) — the weekly seventh day  

This “yearly, monthly, weekly” pattern is a standard Jewish summary of the covenant calendar (cf. 1 Chron 23:31; 2 Chron 2:4; Hos 2:11). Paul does not single one part out—he treats the whole system together.  

If the annual feasts are shadows, then so are the Sabbaths. If the Sabbaths remain binding, then so do the feasts. You cannot divide what Scripture has tied together.

## The Word “Body” in Colossians: What Does Paul Mean?

One of the most important words in Colossians 2:17 is *body*—Greek *sōma*.  Legalists claim that when Paul says, “but the body is of Christ,” he must mean “the body of Christ—that is, the Church—has the authority to decide these matters.” In their own words, they argue that the church is the one qualified to judge how believers should observe Sabbaths and holy days. See also [Rethinking the Sabbath](https://jesusrest.com/read.html?file=Rethinking-the-Sabbath.md).

But is that what Paul actually wrote? Let’s carefully test their claim by looking at how Paul uses the word *sōma* throughout Colossians.

When Paul truly meant “the body” as the Church, he always added an identifier. In Colossians 1:18 we read, *“And He is the head of the body, the church (tēs ekklēsias).”* Again in 1:24, Paul writes, *“…for the sake of His body, which is the church (hos estin hē ekklēsia).”* Notice the consistency: Paul does not leave the meaning to guesswork. If he intends “church,” he explicitly says “the body, the church.”

That pattern makes Colossians 2:17 stand out. Here Paul writes, *“These are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ” (to de sōma tou Christou).* There is no mention of the church at all. He does not say, “the body, the church.” Instead, the phrase is simply “the body of Christ.” Every other time Paul used *sōma* for the church in this letter, he tagged it with *ekklēsia*. The absence here is striking—and deliberate.

Paul’s point is not about church authority; it is about shadow versus substance. The shadows are the Old Covenant rituals—food laws, festivals, new moons, Sabbaths. The body, the *sōma*, is the substance, the reality, which is Christ Himself. Hebrews echoes this same contrast: the law served *“as a copy and shadow of the heavenly things”* (Hebrews 8:5), and was only *“a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things”* (Hebrews 10:1).

This makes the legalist's interpretation a serious mistake. They drag Paul’s earlier phrase from chapter 1 (“the body, the church”) into chapter 2, even though the words “the church” are not written there. That is not exegesis, but eisegesis—reading into the text what is not present. By doing so, they actually undermine Paul’s own warning in this very passage: *“Let no one judge you.”* He was setting the believer free from human judgment over shadows of the law, because the reality is found in Christ.

So what is Paul really saying? He is saying that no one should judge you by Old Covenant shadows. Those shadows only pointed forward. The reality, the substance, is Christ Himself—His body, His work, His fulfillment. The legalists, or our modern day Pharisees reads “church” into Colossians 2:17 where Paul never wrote it. But Scripture, read on its own terms, shows Paul’s contrast is not shadow versus church, but shadow versus Christ.


## Shadows and Substance  

Paul explains: *“which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance [σῶμα, sōma] is of Christ.”*  

The word “shadow” (σκιά, skia) means an outline, a dim preview, not the real thing. The word “substance” (sōma) means “body” or “reality.” Together, they form a contrast: picture versus person, outline versus reality.  

Hebrews 10:1 uses the exact same language: *“For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things…”* The sacrifices, priesthood, and holy days were sketches pointing forward. The reality is Christ Himself.  

Once the person has come, the picture is no longer the focus.

### Paul Names the Entire Calendar  

Paul’s triad — “festival, new moon, Sabbaths” — is not random. This exact formula is used repeatedly in the Old Testament (e.g., 1 Chron 23:31; 2 Chron 2:4; 31:3; Ezek 45:17) to describe Israel’s whole system of sacred times:  

- **Festival** — the yearly holy days.  
- **New moon** — the monthly observance.  
- **Sabbaths** — the weekly day.  

By grouping them, Paul sweeps up the entire covenant calendar. He makes no distinction between them. All are shadows. All are not to be judged on by anyone. Paul is clear, for the church is to judge evil, but where there is no judgement, there is no sin. And there is no more judgement for these days. They can be observed freely or not, but the requirements of any law to be performed for God, has ended with Sinai. God requires faith in His Son. All laws have given way to the body, the substance, which is Christ. It is through Him, that we died to the law, and produce something better than it.

### Shadows Don’t Remain Once the Body Arrives  

Paul’s own language in Hebrews answers this directly:  

> *“The law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never … make those who approach perfect.”* (Hebrews 10:1)  

Yes, the law and its rituals were shadows pointing forward. But the very point of Hebrews is that once Christ came, the shadow was obsolete. Hebrews 10:9 says plainly: *“He takes away the first that He may establish the second.”*  

A shadow has no binding power once the reality has arrived. To cling to the shadow is to miss the point entirely.

### The “Handwriting of Ordinances”  

Legalists try to soften Paul’s words by saying the “handwriting of ordinances” nailed to the cross was only a record of sins, not the law itself. But Paul’s phrase appears elsewhere. In Ephesians 2:15 he writes:  

> *“[Christ] abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances.”*  

The “ordinances” are the law itself, with its commands and prohibitions. And what did that law do? It stood “against us” (Col 2:14), condemning us as guilty. As Paul says elsewhere, *“whatever the law says, it says … that all the world may become guilty before God.”* (Rom 3:19)  

Christ did not just erase the charges against us while leaving the law intact. He fulfilled the law and took it out of the way, nailing the whole system to His cross.  

---

### Paul’s Silence on Commanding Gentiles  

There is another problem,the Colossians were Gentiles. If Paul wanted Gentiles to keep Sabbaths and festivals, Colossians 2 was his perfect chance to say so. Instead, he says the exact opposite: *“Let no one judge you”* about them.  

Paul never commands Gentiles to keep Sabbath. He never warns them against breaking it. His concern is the opposite — that no one should place them under judgment for not keeping the Jewish calendar.  

---

## Why This Matters  

If we cling to shadows, we remain in anxiety — always afraid of breaking a rule, always worried about judgment. But if we embrace the substance, we rest in Christ Himself.  

The legalist burdens its listeners with shadows. Paul points us to the reality. Which will you choose?  


## Paul’s Broader Teaching  

This is consistent with everything else Paul wrote:  

- *“One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind.”* (Rom 14:5)  
- *“But now after you have known God… how is it that you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements… You observe days and months and seasons and years. I am afraid for you.”* (Gal 4:9–11)  
- *“Christ is the end [goal] of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.”* (Rom 10:4)  

Paul never tells Gentile believers to adopt Israel’s calendar. Instead, he warns them not to become enslaved by it, nor judged by others who insist upon it.  

---

## The Human Tendency to Add Works  

Why does this matter? Because human nature craves control. We want to point to something visible—rituals, days, foods—as proof of our righteousness. But Paul insists our righteousness is not in the shadow but in the substance.  

The legalist error is to say we must “qualify” by obedience, by Sabbath-keeping, by clinging to the shadow. But the gospel says: *“He has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light.”* (Col 1:12).  

It is God, not our works, who qualifies us.  

---

## Conclusion: The Reality Has Come  

Colossians 2:16–17 could not be clearer: the covenant calendar—festivals, new moons, Sabbaths—were shadows. The reality is Christ. To cling to the shadow as the requirement of salvation is to miss the substance.

Does this mean Christians cannot enjoy a Sabbath rest or celebrate the festivals? Not at all. These can be beautiful reminders. But they are no longer covenant obligations, no longer signs of belonging.  

The true sign is faith in Christ, sealed by the Spirit. The true rest is not a day on the calendar but a Person who said: *“Come to Me… and I will give you rest.”* (Matt 11:28).  

So let no one judge you. The shadows are gone and the clear reality emerges. That reality is Christ. And in Him, you are complete. (Col 2:10).
