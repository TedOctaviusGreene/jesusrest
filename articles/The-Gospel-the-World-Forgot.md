# **The Gospel the World Forgot**  
### *How Faith in Christ Replaced Every System of Man*

---

## **Preface – To the Reader**

For almost two thousand years the church has spoken of grace, yet few have understood what Paul meant when he said, **“You are not under law but under grace.”** (Romans 6:14, NKJV).  
From the first century until now, believers have drifted between two cliffs—**legalism**, which builds new laws in God’s name, and **license**, which uses grace as permission for sin.  
Between those cliffs lies the narrow path of life: **“Christ in you, the hope of glory.”** (Colossians 1:27)

This letter is written to make that path plain.  It is not a new gospel, but the same that Paul defended before the Galatians and the apostles affirmed in Jerusalem when they said,  
**“It seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden.”** (Acts 15:28)  
The message then is the message now: the covenant of law has ended; the covenant of the Spirit has begun.

## **1. The Confusion of Three Kinds of Believers**

When Paul wrote to the Galatians, he faced three kinds of followers:

1. **Unbelieving Judaizers** — Jews who followed Jesus outwardly but sought to pull Gentiles under Moses.  
2. **Weak Judaizers** — sincere believers still carrying the habits of their old religion.  
3. **Enlightened believers** — men like Paul and Barnabas who knew the cross had ended the old covenant and begun a new creation.

> **“O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth… Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?”**  
> — *Galatians 3:1-3 NKJV*

“Bewitched” translates *baskainō*—to mislead by false fascination.  
The Galatians were mesmerized by the *appearance* of holiness.  

> **“You observe days and months and seasons and years. I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain.”**  
> — *Galatians 4:10-11 NKJV*

Returning to ritual calendars was not innocent—it was regression to **stoicheia**, “the rudiments.”  
The problem was not sin but **system**: trusting ceremonies for righteousness.

> **“For Christ is the end (*telos*, goal and termination) of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.”**  
> — *Romans 10:4 NKJV*

Either Christ’s death finished salvation—or it accomplished nothing.

---

## **2. Why They Judaized**

They compelled circumcision out of fear.

> **“As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh… only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.”**  
> — *Galatians 6:12 NKJV*

They wanted acceptance among their countrymen.  For Jews, to abandon Moses meant exile.  

> **“It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.”**  
> — *Acts 15:5 NKJV*

These *Pharisees who believed* wanted Gentiles to keep **all** of Moses.  
Paul replied:

> **“Every man who becomes circumcised… is a debtor to keep the whole law.”**  
> — *Galatians 5:3 NKJV*

“Debtor” (*opheiletēs*)—bound to the entire covenant.  To re-enter one law was to sign the whole contract again.

Paul’s own testimony exposed the futility:

> **“What things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ… not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ.”**  
> — *Philippians 3:7-9 NKJV*

*Skubalon*—“rubbish.”  All law-based righteousness is refuse compared to knowing Christ.

> **“What the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son… that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who… walk according to the Spirit.”**  
> — *Romans 8:3-4 NKJV*

“Fulfilled” (*plērōthē*)—completed within us.  Holiness now flows from the indwelling Spirit.

---

## **3. The Law System — Then and Now**

> **“A man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ.”**  
> — *Galatians 2:16 NKJV*

“Works of the law” (*ergōn nomou*)—any deeds relied on for favor.  
The principle is eternal: **grace and merit cannot mix.**

> **“If by grace, then it is no longer of works… otherwise grace is no longer grace.”**  
> — *Romans 11:6 NKJV*

Modern forms differ—attendance, tithes, reputations—but the snare is the same:  
faith + performance = bondage.

> **“These people draw near… but their heart is far from Me… teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.”**  
> — *Matthew 15:8-9 NKJV*

Human systems produce religion, not righteousness.

> **“For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.”**  
> — *Galatians 5:13 NKJV*

Liberty is not license—it is love empowered.  
> **“For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.”**  
> — *Romans 6:14 NKJV*

Law gives sin its throne; grace dethrones it.

## **4. What the Council Declared (and What It Meant)**

> **“Why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?”**  
> — *Acts 15:10 NKJV*

The *zygos*—yoke—was the Law itself.  
The apostles decided:

> **“It seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden…”**  
> — *Acts 15:28 NKJV*

“Burden” (*baros*)—weight.  The Law’s load was gone.  
This fulfilled Jesus’ call:

> **“Come to Me… My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”**  
> — *Matthew 11:28-30 NKJV*

The new yoke is **union**.  Ezekiel had foretold it:

> **“I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes.”**  
> — *Ezekiel 36:27 NKJV*

The council’s silence about Moses thundered louder than a thousand decrees.  
Paul explained:

> **“The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life… the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious… but the ministry of the Spirit is more glorious.”**  
> — *2 Corinthians 3:6-8 NKJV*

The Law’s glory has **passed** (*katargoumenē*—rendered inactive); Christ’s glory remains.

---

## **5. The Freedom They Feared**

> **“Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? Certainly not!”**  
> — *Romans 6:1-2 NKJV*

*Mē genoito!* — “Perish the thought.”  Grace doesn’t loosen sin’s grip; it breaks it.

> **“If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.”**  
> — *2 Corinthians 5:17 NKJV*

Freedom scared the legalists—loss of control;  
tempted the libertines—excuse for indulgence.  
Paul corrected both:

> **“For you… have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.”**  
> — *Galatians 5:13 NKJV*

Love fulfills the law (Galatians 5:14).  
> **“The love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.”**  
> — *Romans 5:5 NKJV*

Faith is not permission but participation—Christ living His obedience in us.

> **“If the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.”**  
> — *John 8:36 NKJV*

*Ontōs eleutheroi*—free in reality.  Not symbolic freedom, but life lived in the Spirit.

## **6. The True Way — Abiding in the Vine**

> **“Abide in Me, and I in you… without Me you can do nothing.”**  
> — *John 15:4-5 NKJV*

*Menō*—to remain, dwell, stay joined.  
Jesus replaced external obedience with internal union.

> **“I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.”**  
> — *Galatians 2:20 NKJV*

The Law commands; the Vine produces.  
> **“Delivered from the law… that we should serve in the newness of the Spirit.”**  
> — *Romans 7:6 NKJV*

The Spirit replaces the letter.

### **The Fear of Letting Go of Moses**

Stephen’s stoning (Acts 7) showed the cost of grace; Saul held the coats.  
That same Saul became Paul—the persecutor turned preacher.

> **“Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?”**  
> — *Acts 9:4 NKJV*

Christ so unites Himself to His people that striking them strikes Him.  
From that day Paul lived the opposite of fear.  
> **“That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection.”**  
> — *Philippians 3:10 NKJV*

*Ginoskō auton*—to know by experience.  
The Vine replaced the Law; love replaced fear.

---

## **7. What the World Calls Christianity**

> **“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter… I never knew you.”**  
> — *Matthew 7:21-23 NKJV*

*Egnōn*—to know intimately.  Religion knows *about* Him; relationship knows *Him.*

> **“Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?”**  
> — *Galatians 3:3 NKJV*

The modern church often stops at forgiveness and never reaches transformation.  
> **“If Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life.”**  
> — *Romans 8:10 NKJV*

Attendance replaces abiding; ceremony replaces communion.  
> **“God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”**  
> — *John 4:24 NKJV*

True worship is internal reality, not external form.

> **“We are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit… and have no confidence in the flesh.”**  
> — *Philippians 3:3 NKJV*

Grace always threatens systems because it cannot be controlled.  
> **“For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.”**  
> — *Philippians 1:21 NKJV*

---

## **8. The Faith That Works**

> **“By grace you have been saved through faith… For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works.”**  
> — *Ephesians 2:8-10 NKJV*

*Poiēma*—His poem.  Works follow grace; they do not cause it.

> **“Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.”**  
> — *James 2:17 NKJV*

“Dead” (*nekra*)—lifeless faith has no Spirit.  
Paul agreed: **“Faith working through love.”** (Galatians 5:6)

> **“It is God who works in you both to will and to do.”**  
> — *Philippians 2:13 NKJV*

*Energein*—to energize.  God supplies both desire and action.

> **“The love of Christ compels us.”**  
> — *2 Corinthians 5:14 NKJV*

Love presses where law once pushed.

> **“The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace… Against such there is no law.”**  
> — *Galatians 5:22-23 NKJV*

Grace fulfills what the Law required.

## **9. The Third Kind of Believer — Then and Now**

> **“Of Him you are in Christ Jesus… who became for us righteousness.”**  
> — *1 Corinthians 1:30 NKJV*

God places believers *in* Christ—His righteousness becomes ours.  
> **“There remains therefore a rest for the people of God.”**  
> — *Hebrews 4:9 NKJV*

*Sabbatismos*—spiritual Sabbath.  
They obey from love, endure persecution with joy, and rest in finished grace.  

> **“Abide in Him, that… we may have confidence and not be ashamed.”**  
> — *1 John 2:28 NKJV*

Such believers are luminous, not lawless.  
> **“The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free.”**  
> — *Romans 8:2 NKJV*

Freedom is a finished fact.

## **10. The Message for This Generation**

> **“Stand fast… and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.”**  
> — *Galatians 5:1 NKJV*

Modern Christianity still builds nets of performance.  
> **“Having a form of godliness but denying its power.”**  
> — *2 Timothy 3:5 NKJV*

*Morphōsin*—a mere outline.  Many have the shape of faith without its substance.  

> **“Christ in you, the hope of glory.”**  
> — *Colossians 1:27 NKJV*

The Law said, “Do and live.”  Grace says, “Live, and this will be done.”  

> **“Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?”**  
> — *1 Corinthians 3:16 NKJV*

You are the temple.  The Presence has moved inside.  
Grace removes control; the Spirit now governs from within.  

> **“For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.”**  
> — *Philippians 2:13 NKJV*

This is the gospel the world forgot: righteousness not demanded, but imparted.  
> **“If the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.”**  
> — *John 8:36 NKJV*

*Ontōs eleutheroi*—free in reality.

---

## **Closing Reflection and Prayer**

> **“As you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him.”**  
> — *Colossians 2:6 NKJV*

To walk in Him is to draw life from the Vine.  
Let this be our testimony: that we no longer strive for righteousness,  
but live because His righteousness lives in us.

### **Prayer**

Father of grace,  
Thank You for sending Your Son not to build another system but to give us Your life.  
Forgive us for rebuilding what You tore down.  
Teach us to rest in the finished work of Jesus.  
Let His Spirit bear Your fruit—love, joy, peace, and every good thing.  
When we fear, remind us that perfect love casts out fear.  
When persecution comes, make us steadfast like Stephen, bold like Paul,  
and gentle like Jesus who prayed for His enemies.  

May Your church be known again not for its laws or buildings but for its likeness to Christ—  
the living Vine, the Lord of all.  

**In His name we abide,  
Amen.**
