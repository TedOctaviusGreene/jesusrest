# Galatians 4 and the Bondage of Days, Months, and Seasons

Paul’s words in Galatians 4 ring sharp:  
*“But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage? You observe days and months and seasons and years. I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain.”* (Galatians 4:9–11)

How could Paul describe the observance of days, months, and seasons as **bondage**, when the Bible also says, *“His commandments are not burdensome”* (1 John 5:3)? Is Paul contradicting John? Or is there a deeper truth hidden here that explains the difference between bondage and liberty?

## Commandments That Are Not Burdensome

John wrote, *“For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome”* (1 John 5:3). The question then is: **which commandments?** Was John referring to the Old Covenant rituals — Sabbaths, holy days, sacrifices, purification laws — or something greater?

The answer lies in Jesus’ own words:  
*“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.”* (John 13:34)

Paul calls this the *law of Christ*:  
*“Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.”* (Galatians 6:2)

And James calls it the *law of liberty*:  
*“But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it… this one will be blessed in what he does.”* (James 1:25)

This is the law that is not burdensome: the law of love written on our hearts by the Spirit.

## Why Then Call the Old Covenant a Bondage?

This is the question we must face honestly. If God freed Israel from the iron furnace of Egypt, how could Paul turn around and call the covenant at Sinai another bondage?  

Paul himself uses the word plainly in Galatians 4:24–25:  

*“For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar—for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.”*  

Notice carefully: Paul does not mince words. The covenant given at Sinai “gives birth to bondage.” That means it produces slavery, not freedom. And he ties it directly to the present Jerusalem of his day — the Judaism still clinging to old covenant law — calling it “in bondage with her children.”  

The law was holy, just, and good (Romans 7:12), but its effect upon sinful man was slavery. Why? Because it exposed sin without giving the power to overcome it. Paul explains:  

*“But now we have been delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.”* (Romans 7:6)  

The law held us. It restrained us. It condemned us when we failed. It demanded obedience but gave no Spirit to enable it.  

This is why Peter, standing in Acts 15, called it a yoke:  
*“Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?”* (Acts 15:10)  

Do you see? Egypt’s slavery was physical, but Sinai’s covenant was spiritual slavery for the flesh. Both were bondages. Both were meant to teach us our need for deliverance.  

And so Paul calls the law a **tutor**:  
*“The law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.”* (Galatians 3:24–25)  

Just as a schoolmaster keeps children under restraint, so the law held Israel captive under ceremonies, rituals, and threats of curse. But once Christ came, the believer is set free. To go back to those “weak and beggarly elements” (Galatians 4:9) is to return to slavery.  

The law was not evil — it was purposeful. But its purpose was never to give life. Paul writes:  
*“For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law.”* (Galatians 3:21)  

Instead, the law locked us up under sin:  
*“But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.”* (Galatians 3:22)  

So the law at Sinai was bondage because it bound sinful flesh, condemned without empowering, and held the people in custody until Christ came to set them free.

## Days, Months, and Seasons vs. the Reality in Christ

Paul warns the Galatians: *“You observe days and months and seasons and years. I am afraid for you…”* (Galatians 4:10–11). These were not the simple rhythms of creation (day and night, seedtime and harvest). They were the ritual calendar of the old covenant — Sabbaths, new moons, feast days. These were never given as universal laws for all mankind, but as covenant signs for Israel.

Now that Christ has come, the shadows have met their fulfillment:  
*“So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.”* (Colossians 2:16–17)

The substance — the body, the reality — is Christ. To cling to the shadow when the reality has come is to miss the point. It is bondage to a system that was never meant to last.

## The True Commandments of Liberty

So then, how do we hold together John’s words — *“His commandments are not burdensome”* — with Paul’s warning about bondage? The answer is clear:  

- The **ritual laws** of the old covenant (days, months, seasons, Sabbaths, holy days) are **bondage** when imposed as binding law.  
- The **law of Christ** — love of God and love of neighbor — is the commandment that is not burdensome, because it flows from the Spirit.  

Paul writes, *“The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.”* (Romans 8:2) This is the freedom of the New Covenant.

## Exhortation

Friend, don’t let anyone pull you back into bondage. The days, months, and seasons were shadows — they pointed to Christ, but they are not Christ. The true commandments are not rituals, but love. The law of Christ is the law of liberty, the law of love written by the Spirit.  

> To return to the shadows is slavery. To walk in the Spirit is freedom.  

And so we keep the commandments of God — not the bondage of rituals, but the freedom of love. *“For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome.”* (1 John 5:3)
