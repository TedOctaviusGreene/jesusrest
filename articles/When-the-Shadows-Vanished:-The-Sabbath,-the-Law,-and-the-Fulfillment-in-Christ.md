# **When the Shadows Vanished: The Sabbath, the Law, and the Fulfillment in Christ**
*A teaching letter to those wrestling with the Old Covenant and the New*

---

Beloved friend, let us begin with a single unbreakable truth from Scripture:

> **“The law was a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things.”**  
> *(Hebrews 10:1)*

What God gave at Sinai was holy, just, and good. It revealed His righteousness — His perfection — His holiness. It showed **who He is**, not who we could ever be. But the same law that revealed God’s holiness also revealed our hopelessness.

> **“By the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.”**  
> *(Galatians 2:16)*

So God gave Israel a system — **a system of distance**:
- A holy temple separated from the common world
- A holy priesthood separated from the common man
- A holy nation separated from Gentiles
- Holy foods separated from unclean foods
- Holy days separated from common days
- Holy circumcision separated from uncircumcised flesh
- A holy Sabbath separated from the regular week
- A holy veil separating all from the presence of God
- Holy sacrifices separating sinners from judgment

The purpose of this system was not love — **it was separation**.

The law said: **“Keep away — stay back — you are unfit to approach a holy God.”**

Not because God was cruel, but because He is holy.

> **“Your iniquities have separated you from your God.”**  
> *(Isaiah 59:2)*

The shadow system taught one overwhelming message:
### **God is holy — and man is not.**

And so God provided shadows — symbols — temporary illustrations that stood between man and God. But hear this:

### **Shadows never reconciled anything — they only delayed judgment.**
### **Shadows never expressed love — they expressed distance.**
### **Shadows never changed hearts — they exposed hearts.**

The sacrifices never loved anyone.  
The Sabbath never loved anyone.  
The temple never loved anyone.  
The priesthood never loved anyone.  
Circumcision never loved anyone.  
The dietary laws never loved anyone.  
The stone tablets never loved anyone.

They pointed forward to **the One who would love**, the One who would bring God near, the One who would end separation.

> **“These are a shadow of things to come, but the body (substance) is Christ.”**  
> *(Colossians 2:17)*

# **He Came to Fulfill, Remove Distance, and Give Life**
God Himself came near to us by becoming one of us.

> **“The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.”**  
> *(John 1:14)*

He came as the spotless Lamb.  
He came as the perfect High Priest.  
He came as the true Temple — God dwelling with man.  
He came as the Sabbath rest — the end of works.  
He came as the circumciser of the heart.  
He came as the Bread of Life — not clean animals.  
He came as the One and final sacrifice.

He did what the law illustrated but could never perform.

> **“For what the law could not do, God did by sending His own Son.”**  
> *(Romans 8:3)*

He fulfilled every shadow perfectly — then removed the entire system forever.

> **“He abolished in His flesh the law of commandments contained in ordinances.”**  
> *(Ephesians 2:15)*

> **“The ministry engraved on stones was done away.”**  
> *(2 Corinthians 3:7–11)*

> **“Once faith has come, we are no longer under the tutor.”**  
> *(Galatians 3:25)*

### **The shadows are gone because the Substance has come.**

To cling to shadows after the Son has risen is to refuse the sunrise.

---

# **Why Trying to Keep the Old Covenant Is Impossible**
Because **Christ fulfilled the requirement to dwell with a holy God**, and **only He could**.

We could not.
We never could.
We never will.

To imagine we could keep Sinai is not humility — it is **outrageous pride**.

What arrogance for dust to say:
> **“I can do what God had to become flesh to do.”**

### **He is the Substitute — standing before God instead of us.**
And now:

> **“As He is, so are we in this world.”**  
> *(1 John 4:17)*

Not because we behave like Him —  
but because we are **hidden in Him**.

> **“Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.”**  
> *(Romans 10:4)*

---

# **The Sabbath, Shadows, and the Substance**
Paul commands clearly:

> **“Let no one judge you… regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is Christ.”**  
> *(Colossians 2:16–17)*

The Sabbath was **a sign between God and Israel**, not the world.

> **“It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever.”**  
> *(Exodus 31:17)*

It served separation.  
But now:

> **“He has broken down the middle wall of separation.”**  
> *(Ephesians 2:14)*

When Christ died:

> **“The veil in the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.”**  
> *(Matthew 27:51)*

The wall fell.
The separation ended.
The sign lost its purpose.

### **Rest is now a Person, not a day.**

> **“Come to Me, and *I* will give you rest.”**  
> *(Matthew 11:28)*

> **“We who have believed do enter His rest.”**  
> *(Hebrews 4:3)*

> **“He who has entered His rest has ceased from his works.”**  
> *(Hebrews 4:10)*

### **Can a believer rest on Saturday? Yes — freely.  
Can a believer treat every day alike? Yes — freely.**

> **“One esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind.”**  
> *(Romans 14:5)*

Freedom — not obligation.

# **The Death of the Law in Colossians 2**
Paul declares:

> **“Having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us… He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.”**  
> *(Colossians 2:14)*

- It was *against us*
- It was *taken out of the way*
- It was *nailed to the cross*

### **What is nailed to a cross is dead forever.**

Therefore:

> **“Let no one judge you…”**  
> *(Colossians 2:16)*

The law condemned.  
Christ justifies.

---

# **The Law Strengthens Sin — Grace Destroys It**
Scripture overturns the legalist mindset:

> **“The strength of sin is the law.”**  
> *(1 Corinthians 15:56)*

> **“Apart from the law, sin is dead.”**  
> *(Romans 7:8)*

> **“For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.”**  
> *(Romans 6:14)*

### **Under law → sin rules.**
### **Under grace → sin dies.**

Legalism fears grace.  
Scripture says grace is the only power that breaks sin.

---

# **The New Law — The Law of the Spirit of Life**
> **“The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.”**  
> *(Romans 8:2)*

Two laws — not two versions of the same law.

| Old Covenant | New Covenant |
|--------------|--------------|
| Law of sin and death | Law of the Spirit of life |
| Written on stone | Written on hearts |
| External commands | Internal transformation |
| Condemnation | Life |
| Shadow | Substance |
| Works | Rest |
| Moses | Christ |

### **The law restrains — the Spirit transforms.**
### **The law demands — the Spirit supplies.**
### **The law kills — the Spirit gives life.**
### **The law pressures — the Spirit produces fruit.**

> **“I am the Vine, you are the branches… without Me you can do nothing.”**  
> *(John 15:5)*

The branch does not perform — it abides.

---

# **The Covenant That Died and the Covenant That Lives**
> **“You also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ… that you may be married to another.”**  
> *(Romans 7:4)*

You cannot be married to Moses and Christ at the same time.

To return to law is **spiritual adultery**.

Paul warns:

> **“You who attempt to be justified by law have fallen from grace.”**  
> *(Galatians 5:4)*

### **Christ will not share His bride with Moses.**

---

# **Unity — The Final Purpose**
Legalism divides.
Christ unites.

> **“There is neither Jew nor Greek… for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”**  
> *(Galatians 3:28)*

The law separated.
Christ united.

The law condemned.
Christ justified.

The law demanded.
Christ supplied.

---

# **The Gospel in a Single Sentence**
### **What the law demanded from man, God provided to Himself in Christ — and now gives to us freely.**

Therefore:

### **The law is dead. Christ lives.**
### **The shadows are gone. The substance is here.**
### **Love is the fulfillment.**
### **It is finished.**

> **“For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.”**  
> *(Hebrews 10:14)*

Perfected forever — not improving.
Perfected forever — not progressing.
Perfected forever — not maintained.

### **Christ is enough.**

---

# **Amen**
To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood,
and made us kings and priests unto God:

**All glory to the Lamb.**
