# Should Christians Celebrate Christmas?  
## Christmas divides Christians every year. Some say it’s pagan and sinful; others celebrate it with joy. But what does the Bible actually say? This study clears the fog. Through Scripture alone, discover why the Gospel frees us from the chains of law and invites us into the joy, liberty, and rest Jesus purchased with His finished work.

### Introduction

Every year millions of people type into Google:

- Should Christians celebrate Christmas?
- Is Christmas pagan?
- Is the Christmas tree in Jeremiah 10?
- Are we sinning by keeping Christmas?
- Is it wrong to celebrate Christmas?

---

Every year, sincere believers land in very different places on Christmas—and it’s not because they don’t love Jesus. Some feel deep joy and closeness to Him as they celebrate; others feel a check in their conscience and step away from it. And honestly, part of why this is so confusing is that the Bible itself seems, at first glance, to pull us in different directions.

In one place God says things like **“do not learn the way of the nations”** and **“do not worship the Lord your God in their way,”** and under the letter of that covenant Israel was fenced off from the nations with very strict boundaries. Then in the New Testament we meet a Christ **who tears down the dividing wall**, who **fulfills the law**, who **pours out His Spirit**, and who **sends His people into all nations** with a freedom that doesn’t fit neatly inside the old categories.

If we don’t understand that God is telling one story that moves **from the letter to the Spirit**, **from shadow to substance**, **from separation to indwelling**, the Bible can feel like it’s arguing with itself—and Christmas becomes one more issue where we’re left torn between verses that sound absolute and a Gospel that sounds utterly free.

---

So the real question becomes: **How do we read the Bible in a way that honors the story God is telling?** How do we hold passages that seem to command separation—**“do not worship the Lord your God in their way” (Deuteronomy 12:31), “learn not the way of the nations” (Jeremiah 10:2)**—alongside passages that declare that **Christ has destroyed the dividing wall of separation (Ephesians 2:14)**, **abolished the commandments contained in ordinances (Ephesians 2:15)**, and **set us free from the law entirely (Romans 6:14; Galatians 5:18)**?

The answer is not to choose one set of verses and fight with the others. The answer is to **interpret Scripture the way Scripture commands us to**: letting the Word interpret the Word, **comparing spiritual things with spiritual** (1 Corinthians 2:13), and reading **line upon line, precept upon precept** (Isaiah 28:10), with the unwavering conviction that **God never contradicts Himself—He fulfills Himself.**

Jesus said plainly: **“The Scripture cannot be broken” (John 10:35).** If it appears to break, it is not the Scripture that is fractured—it is our understanding that is incomplete.

---

This is why the Bible contains covenants, and why God ordered His revelation through time, deliberately and progressively. There are commandments that were never meant to last forever, but to serve a purpose until they were fulfilled.

**Paul says the law was added “till the Seed should come” (Galatians 3:19)**, and once that purpose was finished, he declares: **“we are no longer under that tutor” (Galatians 3:25).**

Something real happened at the cross. Something ended. Something better began.

Old covenant commands like **“do not worship Me the way the nations worship their gods”** were spoken into a world **without the indwelling Spirit**, where holiness depended on separation, distinction, and physical boundaries.

But now we live on the other side of Pentecost—**Christ in us, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27)**, writing His law on our hearts, **not on tablets of stone (2 Corinthians 3:3).**

What was once maintained by distance is now fulfilled by indwelling.  
What was once external regulation is now internal transformation.  
The shadow has given way to the body, the letter to the Spirit, distance to union, duty to delight, fear to freedom.

---

So of course it feels confusing if we try to hold both covenants alive at the same time. Of course the Bible seems to disagree with itself if we flatten history and read everything as if nothing changed at the cross.

But when we honor the story God is telling, we see there is no contradiction at all. The commands given to Israel under the first covenant were holy and perfect for their purpose—but their purpose was temporary. Once Christ fulfilled them, they do not continue; they give way. They fall like scaffolding once the real building stands.

And now, in the New Covenant, our holiness is not in avoiding objects or days or customs, but in the presence of Christ within us, **who makes all things clean to the pure** (Titus 1:15).

---

So let’s say it plainly: **if we believe that objects, decorations, trees, dates on a calendar, or cultural customs can contaminate a believer who is filled with the Spirit of the living God, then we have abandoned the Gospel of Christ for a religion of fear.** Scripture does not teach that God’s people are fragile or easily defiled.

Scripture teaches that **we are the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19)**, and **“greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world” (1 John 4:4).** If something as simple as wood and lights has the power to virtually poison a redeemed son or daughter of God, then Christ failed — and we are still slaves.

But **He did not fail. He triumphed.** **“Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 15:57).** Freedom is not fragile. Holiness is not fragile. Christ in us is not fragile.

---

*And here is the plain biblical logic that Paul uses to dismantle fear-based religion: pagans do not own the objects they attach meaning to. They do not own trees. They do not own food. They do not own days. They do not own creation. **“The earth is the LORD’s, and all its fullness” (Psalm 24:1; repeated by Paul in 1 Corinthians 10:26).** God did not surrender His creation to demons. False gods have no power because they are not real. Paul says, **“We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one” (1 Corinthians 8:4).** If an idol is nothing, it cannot contaminate anything. The only power an idol has is the power people imagine and fear it has.*

---

And Paul goes even further, directly attacking the fear that objects or practices can be spiritually dangerous:

> **“Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, asking no question for conscience’ sake.”
> — 1 Corinthians 10:25**

This meat was publicly known to have been sacrificed to idols. It was pagan meat in every sense — and Paul said eat freely. Why?

> **“For the earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness.”
> — 1 Corinthians 10:26**

Paul did not say:

- Touch not  
- Handle not  
- Fear the contamination  
- Separate from the object  

He said eat with liberty because **objects are morally neutral. Evil is not in things. Evil is in hearts.**

> **“To the pure, all things are pure.”
> — Titus 1:15**

Paul directly rebukes the type of fear-based thinking that some Christians now apply to Christmas trees:

> **“Why is my liberty judged by another man’s conscience?”
> — 1 Corinthians 10:29**

> **“For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.”
> — Romans 14:17**

Fear is not discernment. Fear is unbelief. And **“God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and a sound mind”** (2 Timothy 1:7).

So no — a tree covered in lights cannot steal glory from Christ. No — the presence of a pagan practice in history does not contaminate a believer who is in Christ. And no — you are not worshipping demons because you enjoy a holiday with family, give gifts to children, or sit beneath evergreen branches. **Demons are not hiding in plastic branches. We are not fighting vegetation. We walk in the Spirit.**

**The real spiritual danger is not that Christians celebrate Christmas. The real danger is that Christians are terrified to be free — terrified to believe the Gospel they preach. Terrified to trust the finished work of Christ. Terrified of being wrong instead of resting in the One who made us right.**


At JesusRest.com, our pursuit is simple:

## What does God actually say in His Word when we remove assumptions, traditions, fear, and pride?

We search for pure, unadulterated biblical truth that crucifies boasting, exalts Christ alone, humbles the proud, and sets captives free.

So the real question isn’t:

> Is Christmas pagan?

The real question is:

> What is the truth of the Gospel, and what does Jesus Christ actually require of believers under the New Covenant?

---

So then we must ask the next honest question: **If the New Covenant has truly freed us from fear-based religion, how does God call us to walk in that freedom together, especially when our consciences land in different places?** Scripture does not leave us guessing. Paul writes an entire chapter about this exact situation—not about Christmas specifically, but about days, eating, customs, convictions, conscience, and the unity of believers whose outward practices differ while their hearts are fixed on Christ.

> **“Receive one who is weak in the faith, but not to disputes over doubtful things.”**  
> — Romans 14:1

Paul doesn’t say: crush them with arguments, force conformity, accuse, condemn, or draw lines in the sand. He says: **receive them.** Not tolerate them. Receive them. Welcome them with warmth, affection, patience.

And then Paul names the tension:

> **“One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike.”**  
> — Romans 14:5

There it is, right in the Bible—**two believers with two different conclusions about observing a day.** And what does Paul command?

> **“Let each be fully convinced in his own mind.”**  
> — Romans 14:5

Paul does not say:  
“You’re wrong—stop keeping the day.”  
Or: “You’re wrong—start keeping the day.”  

Paul doesn’t take sides. **Because the Gospel already did.** Christ is the side. Faith is the side. Love is the side.

And then Paul reveals God’s perspective on both kinds of believers:

> **“He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it.”**  
> — Romans 14:6

**God receives both.**  
Both honor Christ.  
Both are acceptable.  
Both are free.

So to the brother or sister who celebrates Christmas with joy—Paul says, **do it unto the Lord.**  
And to the brother or sister whose conscience does not celebrate—Paul says, **refrain unto the Lord.**

The issue is never the day.  
It is always **the Lord.**

> **“Therefore let us not judge one another anymore… pursue the things which make for peace and the things by which one may edify another.”**  
> — Romans 14:13,19

Judgment over days is **spiritual immaturity**, not holiness.  
Love is maturity.  
Freedom is maturity.  
Rest is maturity.

And then Paul closes the matter with breathtaking clarity:

> **“Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God.”**  
> — Romans 14:22

Faith is not proven by the calendar one keeps.  
Faith is proven by **resting in Christ** and walking in **love**.

---

### **And Paul reinforces the same truth in Colossians 2**
Some believers argue that observing certain days shows obedience. Others insist avoiding them shows purity. But Paul writes with unmistakable authority:

> **“So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is Christ.”**  
> — Colossians 2:16–17

Let no one judge you.
Let no one condemn you.
Let no one rule you by shadows.

**Why?**

Because *Christ is the substance.*  
The reality.  
The fulfillment.  
The end of the shadows.

You cannot glorify the shadow once the body has come. You cannot cling to a signpost when you have arrived at the destination. And you cannot measure spiritual maturity by calendar observance in a covenant where Christ has replaced the calendar with Himself.

And just a few verses earlier Paul explains what changed:

> **“Having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us… He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.”**  
> — Colossians 2:14

What God nailed to the cross is not still standing.  
What God dismantled does not still govern us.  
What God fulfilled cannot return to rule us.

So we do not tremble at holidays.
We do not fear objects.
We do not worship days.
We do not bow to shadows.

We live in the freedom of Christ, who said:

**“It is finished.”**

---

### **So is celebrating Christmas sin?**
The Bible’s answer is clear and radiant:

If you celebrate Christmas joyfully as unto the Lord — **you honor Christ.**  
If you abstain from Christmas reverently as unto the Lord — **you honor Christ.**  
If you judge and condemn your brother — **you dishonor Christ.**

Sin is not in the day.  
Sin is in the heart that refuses love.  
And **“whatever is not of faith is sin”** (Romans 14:23).

Fear cannot define holiness.  
Only Christ can.  

And Christ has made us free.

## Why Legalism Feels Spiritual — but Leads to Death

The tragedy of legalism is that it feels holy. It feels safe. It feels reverent. It looks disciplined, serious, and devoted. It sounds like the voice of caution, purity, and obedience. It says, *“Better safe than sorry. Better strict than compromised. Better fearful than free.”* And to the flesh, that sounds spiritual. It sounds righteous. It sounds like humility.

But Scripture says the exact opposite.

> **“These things indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed religion, false humility, and neglect of the body, but are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh.”**  
> — Colossians 2:23

Legalism looks wise.  
Legalism looks humble.  
Legalism looks spiritual.  

**But it has no power.**  
No power to produce holiness.  
No power to produce love.  
No power to transform the heart.

Why? Because the flesh cannot perfect what only the Spirit can create. Paul cries this out to the Galatians, who began with freedom and then tried to add law to “improve” their walk:

> **“Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?”**  
> — Galatians 3:3

Legalism begins with good intentions.  
But it ends in slavery, comparison, pride, fear, anxiety, boasting, and judgment.

> **“This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you.”**  
> — Galatians 5:8

Legalism is not the voice of God.  
The Spirit never leads into bondage.  
The Spirit never leads backward into fear.

> **“Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.”**  
> — Galatians 5:1

Bondage is not holiness.  
Bondage is unbelief wearing religious clothing.

Paul says when we try to live by law, we actually *fall from grace*:

> **“You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.”**  
> — Galatians 5:4

Legalism feels spiritual — but it cuts us off from the very life we seek.  
It replaces Christ with self-effort.  
It replaces love with regulation.  
It replaces rest with striving.  

**To choose law is to choose death**, not because the law was evil, but because the law’s purpose was temporary — a tutor leading us to Christ (Galatians 3:24). Once we reach Christ, we do not go back to the tutor. We do not crawl back into the prison that He opened from the inside. We walk forward in the Spirit.

## What True Worship Is Under the New Covenant

So if holiness is not found in avoiding objects and days, where is it found? Jesus answers in one sentence that shattered the entire religious world:

> **“The hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.”**  
> — John 4:23

Not in the mountain, not in Jerusalem.  
Not in the calendar, not in the ceremony.  
Not in separation, but in **Spirit**.  
Not in shadows, but in **truth**.

Worship is no longer geographic.  
Worship is no longer external.  
Worship is no longer about regulation or restriction.  
Worship is **union**.

Christ in us.  
Spirit within us.  
Love flowing from us.

The Spirit writes the law on our hearts (2 Corinthians 3:3).  
The Spirit produces fruit that no law could ever produce (Galatians 5:22-23).  
The Spirit transforms us from glory to glory (2 Corinthians 3:18).

**The letter commands but cannot empower.  
The Spirit indwells and therefore produces.**

That is the New Covenant.

That is why Paul says:

> **“Let no one judge you…”**  
> — Colossians 2:16

because judgment belongs to the law,  
and **we are no longer under the law** (Romans 6:14).

That is why Paul says:

> **“Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.”**  
> — 2 Corinthians 3:17

not fear,  
not suspicion,  
not anxiety,  
not bondage.

And that is why Paul says:

> **“The only thing that counts is faith working through love.”**  
> — Galatians 5:6

Not the calendar.  
Not the shadows.  
Not the externals.  

**The only thing that counts is Christ in us producing love.**

So whether you celebrate Christmas or do not —  
**if love is present, Christ is present.**  
**If freedom is present, the Spirit is present.**  
**If peace and joy are present, the Kingdom is present.**

Because:

> **“The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.”**  
> — Romans 14:17

The Kingdom is not in the day.  
The Kingdom is in the Spirit.

The sign of true worship is not refusal — it is **love**.  
Not restriction — but **rest**.  
Not fear — but **freedom**.

Christ has brought us home, not to a holiday, but to Himself.

## So What About Pagan Roots?  
**Does history define holiness — or does Christ?**

This is where many sincere believers stumble. They say, *“But Christmas has pagan roots.”* And we must answer honestly: yes, many ancient cultures used trees, winter feasts, lights, and gift-giving in celebration of their gods. We do not deny history; we simply refuse to bow to it. Because the question is not what pagans once did. The question is: **what does Christ say now?**

Does the past ownership of a practice eternally define its meaning?  
Do demons lay permanent claim to objects, dates, or symbols?  
Are Christians forever forbidden from using anything that was once misused?

If that were true, then Christians could not:
- use the names of days (all named after pagan gods),
- use wedding rings (pagan),
- eat food formerly sacrificed to idols,
- use buildings, music, instruments, art, or seasons,
- or even speak the language we speak (rooted in pagan cultures).

**If the past defines the present, then the cross has no power.**  
If objects can be permanently contaminated, then creation belongs to demons, not to God.

But Scripture declares with thunder:

> **“The earth is the LORD’s, and all its fullness.”**  
> — Psalm 24:1 / 1 Corinthians 10:26

God owns creation. Not pagans. Not demons. Not history.

And Paul explicitly destroys the idea that objects are spiritually dangerous because someone once misused them:

> **“We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.”**  
> — 1 Corinthians 8:4

If an idol is nothing, then it cannot curse, stain, or contaminate anything.

Paul takes the most extreme example available — **meat literally sacrificed to idols in a pagan temple**, the clearest association with idolatry — and says:

> **“Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, asking no question for conscience’ sake.”**  
> — 1 Corinthians 10:25

He does not say:
- *burn it, avoid it, fear it, condemn it.*

He says *eat it freely* — because **objects do not carry spiritual power**. Hearts do.

Evil is not stored in matter.  
Evil is not transferred through objects.  
Evil is not absorbed from decorations or days.

> **“To the pure, all things are pure.”**  
> — Titus 1:15

It is unbelief — not holiness — that trembles before created things.

Because Scripture also says:

> **“God has not given us a spirit of fear.”**  
> — 2 Timothy 1:7

Fear is not discernment.  
Fear is not righteousness.  
Fear is bondage disguised as wisdom.

**Demons are not hiding in plastic branches. We are not fighting vegetation.**  
We fight unbelief that shrinks the victory of Christ and treats the finished work like it is fragile.

And perhaps most powerfully: **Christ Himself did not avoid pagan spaces or pagan customs** — He walked freely into the world that Israel was once commanded to avoid. He touched lepers. He entered Gentile homes. He sat at tables with sinners. His disciples ate grain with unwashed hands. He stood in the temple courts during Hanukkah (John 10:22–23), a holiday nowhere commanded in Scripture and rooted in Jewish tradition.

Jesus showed us what freedom looks like.
Not separation from the world — but **victory in the world**.

If Christ could walk among idols without contamination, how much more those who are filled with His Spirit?

---

## The Power of Redemption Over the Power of History

The Gospel does not avoid what was misused.  
**The Gospel redeems it.**

God’s story is never:
- burn the wood,
- fear the objects,
- abandon creation.

God’s story is always:
- bring light where darkness was,
- reclaim what was misused,
- fill what was empty,
- raise what was dead.

That is why Paul says:

> **“Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.”**  
> — Romans 12:21

Overcome — not avoid.  
Redeem — not retreat.  
Transform — not tremble.

So is it sin to set up a tree?  
To hang lights?  
To give gifts?  
To celebrate the incarnation?

Not if Christ is the center.

Sin is not found in objects but in hearts.  
And **the heart that loves, honors, and delights in Christ cannot sin by celebrating Him.**

The only real sin in this discussion is the one Paul warns of:

> **“Let us not judge one another anymore.”**  
> — Romans 14:13

Judgment destroys.  
Love builds up (1 Corinthians 8:1).

---

## So what is the real issue?

Not pagan history.  
Not decorations.  
Not dates.  
Not customs.

The real issue is **whether we believe the Gospel enough to be free.**

**The real bondage is the fear of freedom.  
The real idolatry is trusting the law more than Christ.  
The real danger is choosing shadows over substance.**

Christ is not glorified when His people live afraid.
Christ is glorified when His people live free.

And **it is for freedom that Christ has made us free** (Galatians 5:1).

So whether you eat or drink, decorate or abstain, celebrate or refrain —

> **“Do all to the glory of God.”**  
> — 1 Corinthians 10:31

Because **the glory is in Christ — not in the calendar.**
Because **the victory is in Christ — not in avoiding branches.**
Because **the worship is in the Spirit — not in the shadows.**

## The Incarnation: Why Celebrating the Birth of Christ Is Beautiful and Biblical

Before we move further, let us set something precious and immovable before our hearts: **God became flesh.** The Infinite stepped into the finite. Eternity entered time. The Creator entered His creation. Heaven touched earth and wrapped itself in skin and bone. Angels sang. Shepherds trembled. A star stood still. The Word became flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14).

If there is anything worth remembering, celebrating, honoring, rejoicing over, singing about, weeping over, and proclaiming to the ends of the earth—**it is that moment.**

And yes—**it is very possible, even likely, that Jesus was born in the fall**, when shepherds would still be living with their flocks in the fields at night (Luke 2:8). Scholars and historians make good arguments for it. No honest student ignores the evidence.

But here is the freedom of the New Covenant:

**We are no longer commanded by dates.**  
We are led by the Spirit.

If the exact day mattered to God for our worship, the Spirit would have revealed it. The Bible is never vague when obedience depends on precision. Under the old covenant God specified dates down to the day, month, and instrument to be played. But in the New Covenant, He gives **no date for celebrating the birth of Christ**. Why?

Because the point is not the day.  
**The point is the Person.**

And so, whether December 25th or September or any day under the sun—**if Christ is honored, Christ is glorified.**

Paul says:

> **“One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind.”**  
> — Romans 14:5

God does not sanctify a date.  
God sanctifies hearts.

---

### What About Birthdays?

Some raise the objection that birthdays in Scripture appear with troubling associations: Pharaoh’s feast that led to execution (Genesis 40:20–22), and Herod’s birthday celebration that ended in the beheading of John the Baptist (Matthew 14:6–10). And from those two accounts—only two in the entire Bible—some conclude that recognizing birthdays is sinful.

But read carefully:  
The evil in those stories was not the birthday.  
It was the **hearts of wicked men**.

It was pride, drunkenness, violence, lust, and murderous oath—not a calendar date—that brought death. If we believe that the day itself caused the evil, we have returned again to superstition and fled from the truth that Jesus taught so plainly:

> **“For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts…”**  
> — Mark 7:21

**Evil is not in days. Evil is in hearts.**  
And Christ came to give us a new heart.

And ironically—beautifully—it is a birth that becomes the very center of the Gospel story. If celebrating a birth is inherently sinful, then **why did heaven erupt in worship at His?**

> **“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men!”**  
> — Luke 2:14

Heaven celebrated.  
Angels proclaimed.  
Creation bowed low.  
The incarnation shook the universe.

If heaven can celebrate His birth, earth may certainly do the same.

---

### What About “Adding a Practice”?

Some protest, saying: *“There is no command to celebrate His birth. We must not add practices!”* But this argument collapses under the weight of Scripture itself.

There is no command to:
- use musical instruments in worship in the New Testament,
- sing hymns from songbooks,
- meet in buildings owned by churches,
- read Scripture aloud in chapters and verses,
- hold weddings in sanctuaries,
- preach sermons 45 minutes long,
- use microphones, livestreams, or printed Bibles,
- celebrate the resurrection annually rather than daily.

And yet no one claims these things are sin.

Because **practice is not law.**  
Practice is freedom.  
And freedom is the foundation of the New Covenant.

Paul teaches that under the New Covenant we live not by external regulation, but by the law of love written by the Spirit (2 Corinthians 3:3; Romans 13:10). Therefore:

**If celebrating the incarnation is done in love, it is righteous.**  
**If abstaining from it is done in love, it is righteous.**  
**Anything not from faith is sin—not anything not commanded.**  
(Romans 14:23)

To the legalist, freedom looks dangerous.  
To the fearful heart, freedom looks reckless.  
But to the believer who knows Christ—freedom is worship.

The incarnation is the **opening note of redemption**.  
It is the beginning of the New Creation.  
It is God with us.  
Immanuel.

And if heaven celebrated that day,
we may join the song.

## How the Early Church Used Cultural Festivals to Proclaim Christ  
**(Paul at Mars Hill and the Pattern of New Covenant Evangelism)**

If there is any doubt about whether believers may engage with cultural celebrations or environments once associated with pagan worship, Scripture settles it with clarity—not by theory, but by example. The early church did not run from pagan culture; **they walked straight into it carrying the light of Christ**. They did not separate themselves behind walls of fear; **they stepped into the world with a bold and liberated Gospel.**

And nowhere is this more powerfully demonstrated than in **Acts 17**, when Paul stands in the very heart of pagan worship—**the Areopagus of Athens**, surrounded by statues, idols, temples, and altars to false gods. A place God once commanded Israel to destroy, avoid, and tear down becomes the very platform where Paul preaches Christ crucified and risen.

> **“Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, ‘Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious.’”**  
> — Acts 17:22

He did not run.  
He did not separate himself from the environment.  
He did not fear contamination.

He stood in the middle of it.  
**He used their culture as a bridge to the Gospel.**

Paul does something astonishing: he quotes their poets (verse 28), acknowledges their altar “to the unknown god,” and uses it as a doorway to reveal the true God.

> **“Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you.”**  
> — Acts 17:23

Paul did not rebuke them for having the altar.  
He transformed its meaning with the Gospel.

He did not say,
- *“You must abandon every symbol that once held pagan significance.”*
- *“Destroy your cultural forms before you can be saved.”*

He said,
**“Let me show you who this is truly about.”**

Paul understood something that many do not:  
**The Gospel redeems what the enemy once claimed.**  
It does not surrender culture; it transforms it.

He did not accuse them of idolatry first—though it was real and severe.  
He preached Christ first.  
Because only Christ has the power to destroy idols. Fear can't. Seperation can't. Regulation can't.

That is why Paul later wrote:

> **“Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.”**  
> — Romans 12:21

The New Covenant strategy is not retreat.  
It is **redemptive invasion**.

Where the law said:
- *Separate.*
- *Destroy.*
- *Do not touch.*
- *Do not learn the way of the nations.*

The Spirit now says:
- *Go into all the world.* (Mark 16:15)
- *Be light in darkness.* (Matthew 5:14–16)
- *Redeem the time.* (Ephesians 5:16)
- *Become all things to all men that you might save some.* (1 Corinthians 9:22)

Paul walked boldly into pagan festivals and marketplaces knowing something many believers today forget:

> **“We are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.”**  
> — Romans 8:37

You do not conquer darkness by hiding from it.  
You conquer darkness by shining in it.

So when a Christian enters a cultural celebration—even one touched by pagan history—they do not bring Christ into danger; they bring Christ into victory. They do not risk contamination; they bring transformation. **Light is not contaminated by darkness. Darkness is destroyed by light.**

## The Pattern of Evangelism in the New Covenant

The early church preached in synagogues, marketplaces, courts, theaters, festivals, and homes. They preached Christ during Passover, during Pentecost, during Greek philosophical gatherings, and during Roman civic events. They preached where people gathered.

They **did not create distance**—they created access.

And that is why **Christmas**, even with its mixed history, is one of the greatest evangelistic opportunities of the year. Because for a brief moment, the whole world stops. The hardest hearts soften. The air is full of music about a Savior. People who never speak of God suddenly sing His name. Strangers exchange kindness. Families gather. Children listen. People search for meaning.

Legalism says:  
*Avoid it because pagans once used it.*

The Gospel says:  
**Redeem it because Christ now owns it.**

And the pattern of Acts confirms it.

## So what should believers do?

Exactly what Paul did.

**Step into the culture.  
Declare the truth.  
Redeem the moment.  
Shine the light.  
Preach Christ.  
Make much of Jesus.**

If Paul could preach in front of idols,  
we can certainly preach beneath a tree.

If Paul could stand on Mars Hill,  
we can stand in living rooms full of family.

And if the early church could sing in prisons,  
we can sing in December.

**Because Christ is Lord of every day, every place, every object, every symbol, every culture, every nation, and every story.**

> **“Of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end.”**  
> — Isaiah 9:7

The Kingdom is advancing—not retreating.

And we do not hide from the world.  
**We conquer it with love.**

## A Call to Unity, Rest, and Love  
**The Final Word of the New Covenant**

So here we arrive at the heart of it all—not the argument about trees or days, not the history of pagan festivals, not the tug-of-war between tradition and reaction, but **the call of Christ to His people**.

If we trust Jesus, truly trust Him, then we must trust what He has finished.  
If we trust the cross, we must trust the freedom it purchased.  
If we trust the Spirit, we must trust the unity He creates.

Because the New Covenant is not a covenant of **rules**, but a covenant of **relationship**.
A covenant written **not on stone**, but **on hearts**.
A covenant held together **not by fear**, but **by love**.

Paul pleads with the church—pleads with us now across centuries:

> **“Let us pursue the things which make for peace and the things by which one may edify another.”**  
> — Romans 14:19

Pursue peace.  
Pursue edification.  
Pursue love.

Do not pursue being right.  
Do not pursue winning an argument.  
Do not pursue the satisfaction of proving someone wrong.

The law produces sides.
The Spirit produces brothers.

The law produces suspicion.
The Spirit produces trust.

The law produces judgment.
The Spirit produces joy.

> **“For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.”**  
> — Romans 14:17

If righteousness, peace, and joy disappear,  
**the Kingdom has been replaced by religion.**

And Paul gives a warning sharper than any sword:

> **“Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food.”**  
> — Romans 14:20

Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of **a day**.
For the sake of **a tree**.
For the sake of **a holiday**.

The real sin has never been celebrating Christmas.
The real sin has always been **failing to love**.

> **“By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.”**  
> — John 13:35

Not if you avoid days.  
Not if you observe days.  
Not if you separate from trees.  
Not if you stand against culture.

**If you love.**

Because love is the fulfillment of the law (Romans 13:10).  
Love is the proof of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–23).  
Love is the mark of Christ.

### So here is the freedom of the Gospel:

If you celebrate Christmas — celebrate **unto the Lord**, reveling in the miracle of God made flesh, singing with angels that peace has come and Christ is born.

If you refrain from Christmas — refrain **unto the Lord**, worshiping quietly in conviction, honoring Christ with a heart of reverence and simplicity.

Both are holy.  
Both are beautiful.  
Both honor Jesus.

But if you stand in judgment, looking down on your brother:
- demanding your way,
- dividing the Body,
- wielding fear instead of faith,

then no matter what day you keep or what day you refuse, **you have left the Gospel behind.**

> **“Whatever is not from faith is sin.”**  
> — Romans 14:23

Faith is freedom.  
Faith is rest.  
Faith is love.  
Faith is Christ.

And Christ is not the author of bondage, suspicion, or fear—  
**He is the Author of peace.**

> **“God is not the author of confusion, but of peace.”**  
> — 1 Corinthians 14:33

So let us lay down the weapons.  
Let us silence the fear.  
Let us refuse the division.  
Let us return to **Jesus**, the center of everything.

Let every heart prepare Him room.  
Let every voice proclaim His glory.  
Let every believer walk in love.

Because **the world will not know Christ by our holidays, but by our hearts**.
Not by trees, but by truth.
Not by separation, but by unity.
Not by fear, but by freedom.
Not by law, but by love.

And in that love we declare to all people everywhere:

**Joy to the world — the Lord has come.  
Let earth receive her King.**
