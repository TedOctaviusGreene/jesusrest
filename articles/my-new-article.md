# Was the Prohibition to Work on the Sabbath Observed After Jesus Instituted the New Covenant?

## Understanding the Old Covenant and Its End

Before we can evaluate whether Christians must keep the Sabbath, we need to understand the covenant under which the Sabbath was given—and why such a covenant was necessary in the first place.

The God of Scripture is both unimaginably holy and deeply loving. He longs to dwell among His people, yet His blazing holiness cannot tolerate sin (Ex 19:16-21). To protect sinful humans from being consumed by His glory, the Lord often revealed Himself through *“the angel of the LORD,”* a messenger who veiled His presence (Ex 3:2; Judg 6:12–23). The law and sacrificial system were gracious, provisional measures that allowed a holy God to live among a sinful nation. They taught Israel that sin separates us from God and that blood must be shed to cover guilt (Lev 17:11). The Sinai covenant therefore functioned as a tutor, revealing both God’s holiness and our need for a mediator—and foreshadowing the remedy that would come through the Messiah.

The covenant made at Sinai was not a loose collection of moral principles but a national constitution binding Israel to God. Moses read *“all the words of the Lord and all the judgments”* to the people, who responded, *“All that the Lord has said we will do”* (Ex 24:3). He then took the book of the covenant, sprinkled it with blood, and said, *“This is the blood of the covenant which the Lord has made with you according to all these words”* (Ex 24:7-8). The covenant included the Ten Commandments written on stone as well as statutes and ordinances governing civil and ceremonial life. James later summarised its integrated nature:

> *“Whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all.”*
> — James 2:10

Under that covenant the commands and statutes were inseparable: violating any part breached the whole. For example, an Israelite who gathered sticks on the Sabbath was stoned to death (Num 15:32-36), and one who secretly worshipped other gods was likewise executed (Deut 17:2-5). The covenant was a single package—its moral commands and its ritual prohibitions carried the same weight. You cannot arbitrarily lift one practice from this covenant while discarding others without breaking the agreement itself.

The covenant’s enforcement relied on a Levitical priesthood and a temple system. If an Israelite sinned, he brought sacrifices to the tabernacle where priests mediated between him and God. The high priest entered the Most Holy Place once a year on the Day of Atonement, separated from the people by a heavy veil. This entire system—the tablets of stone, the priesthood and the sacrificial rituals—stood or fell together. To “abolish” one part while retaining another was impossible.

Because this covenant was indivisible, its signs were entrusted to a specific people rather than to all humanity. Exodus 31 underscores that the weekly Sabbath was given as a sign between the Lord and *“the children of Israel”* throughout their generations (Exod 31:16–17). It reminded Israel that the Lord had sanctified them and delivered them from Egyptian bondage (Deut 5:15).

Scripture never commands Gentile nations to rest on Israel’s Sabbath; instead, Isaiah foresees foreigners willingly joining themselves to the Lord and choosing to keep His Sabbath because they love His name (Isa 56:6–7). Under the old covenant, however, violating this sign was as serious as idolatry: gathering sticks on the Sabbath or secretly serving other gods incurred the death penalty (Num 15:32–36; Deut 17:2–5). You cannot detach one statute from that covenant and carry it into the new covenant without tearing the covenant itself.

## Why Did God End the Covenant?

Because it was preparatory. The law functioned as a guardian to lead Israel to Christ (Gal 3:24). Its priesthood, sacrifices and holy-day calendar were foreshadows pointing toward a greater reality. To grasp what that reality is, the letter to the Hebrews invites us to ponder *rest.*

## Conclusion: Resting in Christ, Not a Calendar

When Jesus inaugurated the new covenant and tore the temple veil, He closed the book on a legal system that was designed for a specific people, time and purpose. Armstrong was right that the Sabbath predates Sinai and that Israel’s identity was tied to it. He was wrong, however, to detach the Sabbath from the covenant in which it served as a sign.

The old covenant has been fulfilled; its sign has served its purpose. Christians may certainly enjoy the rest and rhythm of a weekly Sabbath, just as they may celebrate Israel’s festivals to appreciate God’s redemptive plan. But these observances are no longer covenant obligations. Instead:

> *“There remains a sabbath-rest for the people of God.”*
> — Hebrews 4:9

That rest is found not in a day but in the finished work of Christ. By resting in Him, we honor the substance rather than clinging to the shadow.
