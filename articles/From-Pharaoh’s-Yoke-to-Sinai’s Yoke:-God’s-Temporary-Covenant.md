# From Pharaoh’s Yoke to Sinai’s Yoke: God’s Temporary Covenant

## Why Did God Deliver Israel from Bondage Only to Put Them Back Under the Law?

Israel’s story begins with freedom. God broke the yoke of Pharaoh, parted the Red Sea, and brought His people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. *“I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.”* (Exodus 20:2)

But soon after, at Sinai, God bound them under another system — a covenant of commands, sacrifices, and ceremonies. And the apostles themselves later called that covenant a **yoke of bondage**. Peter said:  
*“Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?”* (Acts 15:10)

Why would God deliver His people from slavery in Egypt only to bind them under Sinai? The answer is not random. It reveals God’s wisdom and the very purpose of the law.

## Sinai as Bondage

Paul writes in Galatians 4:24–25:  
*“For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar—for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.”*

The covenant at Sinai *gave birth to bondage.* It produced slavery, not freedom. Israel left Pharaoh’s lash only to live under curses for disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). Their life was fenced in by rituals and penalties, always threatened by judgment.  

This is why Paul calls the law a ministry of condemnation and death:  
*“But if the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious… how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious?”* (2 Corinthians 3:7–8)

Egypt’s chains were made of iron. Sinai’s chains were made of stone. But both were chains.

## The Purpose of the Law

So why would God put Israel under Sinai? Paul answers the question directly:  
*“What purpose then does the law serve? It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made.”* (Galatians 3:19)

The law was not the cure. It was the diagnosis. It exposed sin, multiplied guilt, and made clear that no one could stand righteous by their own obedience.

Paul says:  
*“Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more.”* (Romans 5:20)

The law revealed the disease so that grace could reveal the cure.

## A Tutor, Not a Savior

The law was temporary, a guardian until Christ came:  
*“Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.”* (Galatians 3:24–25)

Like a strict schoolmaster, the law fenced Israel in. Every sacrifice reminded them of guilt. Every festival shadowed something greater. Every commandment carved on stone revealed sin but could not cleanse it.  

The law shut men up under sin so that the promise by faith in Jesus might be revealed (Galatians 3:22). It was never meant to be permanent. It was meant to prepare.

## A Covenant with Faults

Hebrews declares boldly that the first covenant was not faultless:  
*“For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.”* (Hebrews 8:7)

God Himself promised something better:  
*“Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah—not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers… because they did not continue in My covenant.”* (Hebrews 8:8–9)

The covenant at Sinai was temporary, imperfect, destined to give way to the new. It was never the final answer.

## Christ, the True Deliverance

God freed Israel from Egypt to show His power. He bound them under Sinai to show their need. But in Christ He fulfilled the promise:  
*“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.”* (Romans 10:4)

At last the shadow gave way to substance. The yoke was broken. The tutor dismissed. The bondage ended.  

The New Covenant is not slavery but freedom. It is not written on stone but on hearts. It is not enforced by curses but empowered by the Spirit.

## Exhortation

Beloved, do not stumble over the wisdom of God. He did not lead Israel out of Egypt only to leave them bound forever at Sinai. He led them through Sinai to point to Christ. The law had a purpose — to reveal sin, to preserve a people, to prepare for the Savior.  

But now the Savior has come. The tutor’s job is done. The yoke is broken.  

> Do not return to Sinai. Do not rebuild what Christ tore down. Walk instead in the liberty of the Spirit, the law of Christ, the commandments of love written on your heart.
