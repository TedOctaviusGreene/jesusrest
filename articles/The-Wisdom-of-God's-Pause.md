# The Wisdom of God’s Pause: How the New Covenant Transforms the Feasts

Dear friend,  

You and I share something in common: we both love the Bible. And we both care deeply about honoring God, not the traditions of men. That is why I want to invite you to walk with me through the Scriptures carefully and slowly, with reverence, to see what God actually says about the feasts, the Sabbath, and the New Covenant.  

My heart in writing this is not to condemn, but to search with you. We both want the truth, wherever it leads, and so let us allow the Word of God to guide us step by step.

## Chapter 1: The Feasts Under Sinai — Signs and Shadows

The feasts of the Lord were never man’s idea. They were God’s own holy days, and He called them *“the feasts of the LORD”* in Leviticus 23:2. This means they were not Israel’s festivals, but His. He gave them to Israel at Mount Sinai as covenant signs.  

Exodus 31:13 records God’s command:  

> *“Surely My Sabbaths you shall keep, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.”*  

This verse teaches that the Sabbath was not only a day of rest, but also a covenant sign. It marked Israel as distinct, set apart by God.  

In verse 17 the Lord adds:  

> *“It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.”*  

The emphasis is that the Sabbath was a sign between God and Israel. This was never a universal command to all nations, but a covenant marker given to one people.  

Numbers 15:32–36 tells the story of the man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath. God commanded that he be stoned to death.  

The point is clear: to break the Sabbath was to break the covenant itself, and covenant breach demanded death.  

But the feasts and Sabbaths had a second role. Paul explains it in Colossians 2:16–17:  

> *“Therefore let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.”*  

This verse shows us that the feasts were **shadows** pointing to Christ. They had covenant function in Israel and prophetic function pointing forward.  

Now this naturally raises a question: if the feasts and Sabbaths were covenant signs and prophetic shadows, **what became of that covenant itself?** Was it meant to last forever, or did it come to an end in Christ? Let us turn the page and find out.

## Chapter 2: How the Sinai Covenant Ended

If the feasts and Sabbaths were covenant signs, then our first task is to ask: did that covenant end, or is it still binding today?  

Deuteronomy 4:13 gives us the starting point:  

> *“So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone.”*  

The covenant was not separate from the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments were the covenant.  

Deuteronomy 9:9 repeats this:  

> *“When I went up into the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which the LORD made with you…”*  

The tablets of stone were the tablets of the covenant.  

Genesis shows God resting on the seventh day, but nowhere do we find mankind commanded to keep it before Sinai. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob never observed a weekly Sabbath. The first time the Sabbath appears as a command is in Exodus 16, just before Sinai:  

> *“Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not.”* (Exodus 16:4)  

The Sabbath was a blessing of rest and a test of faith. But it was new, not eternal law from creation. James 1:13 reminds us:  

> *“God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone.”*  

This proves the Sabbath was not moral law before Sinai. It was a covenant sign.  

Paul confirms this in 2 Corinthians 3:7–11, calling the law on stone “the ministry of death” that was “passing away.”  

Hebrews 8:13 says:  

> *“In that He says, ‘A new covenant,’ He has made the first obsolete. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.”*  

Hebrews 10:9–10 adds:  

> *“He takes away the first that He may establish the second. By that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.”*  

Colossians 2:14 ties this to the cross:  

> *“Having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us… He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.”*  

Therefore, Paul says in verse 16:  

> *“Therefore let no one judge you… regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths.”*  

Romans 4:15 explains why:  

> *“Where there is no law there is no transgression.”*  

Galatians 3:19, 24–25 concludes:  

> *“The law… was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come… Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ… But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.”*  

Even prophecy shows the shift. At Sinai, Sabbath-breaking brought death. In Zechariah 14, refusal to keep Tabernacles brings no rain or plague—not death.  

The conclusion is unshakable: the Sinai covenant has ended. The Ten Commandments, including the Sabbath, were covenant law. They are not our covenant today. The morality they reflected remains, but the covenant structure is gone.  

So then, if the covenant has ended, what role do the feasts play today?

## Chapter 3: The Feasts in the Church Age — Shadows Still Working, Not Laws Still Binding

Colossians 2:16–17 makes it plain:  

> *“Let no one judge you… regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.”*  

The feasts are no longer covenant law. They are shadows pointing to Christ. Observing them freely as teaching tools is not condemned, but binding them as commands is wrong.  

Romans 14:5–6 confirms the freedom:  

> *“One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind.”*  

If feast-keeping were commanded, Paul could not write this.  

The spring feasts have been fulfilled in Christ’s death, resurrection, and Pentecost. The fall feasts await His return. God still uses them as prophecy, but they are not binding law.

## Chapter 4: Why the Shift Was Necessary

Why did God shift the role of the feasts?  

Because Christ must be the center. Galatians 4:10–11 warns:  

> *“You observe days and months and seasons and years. I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain.”*  

Because the gospel had to leap the wall of Sinai. Ephesians 2:14–15 says:  

> *“He has broken down the middle wall of separation… abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments contained in ordinances.”*  

Because the Spirit is the new badge of God’s people. Romans 8:9 declares:  

> *“If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.”*  

And Jesus said in John 13:35:  

> *“By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.”*  

Spirit and love, not calendars, mark the true church.  

But if the feasts are no longer law, why do they appear again in prophecy?

## Chapter 5: Why They Return in the Millennium — Royal Statutes

Zechariah 14 describes the nations going up to keep Tabernacles.  

But unlike Sinai, the penalty is not death. Instead:  

> *“On them there will be no rain.”* (Zechariah 14:17)  

Egypt receives a plague, not stoning.  

This shows feasts in the millennium are not covenant law. They are royal statutes of the King, teaching tools for mortal nations. Tabernacles fits perfectly—it pictured God dwelling with His people, and Christ will then dwell visibly with the nations.  

But even this is not the end.

## Chapter 6: The Final Fulfillment in Eternity

Revelation 21:3 declares:  

> *“Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them.”*  

And verse 22 adds:  

> *“I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.”*  

This is the true and final Tabernacles. No temple. No calendar. No shadow. God Himself dwelling with His people forever.  

But before we close, we must face one objection: *Didn’t Paul keep the feasts?*

## Chapter 7: Did Paul Keep the Feasts? Narrative, Not Command

Yes, Acts records Paul attending feasts.  

Acts 18:21:  

> *“I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem.”*  

Acts 20:16:  

> *“He was hurrying to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the Day of Pentecost.”*  

But these are not instructions. They are **narrative time stamps.** Luke, writing Acts, was recording history, not commands.  

The Jewish world still revolved around Sinai. Old habits die hard. Paul used feasts as opportunities to preach Christ. 1 Corinthians 9:20 explains:  

> *“To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews.”*  

Paul himself forbids making them law in Colossians 2:16.  

To claim “Christ in us keeps the feasts” is dangerous. If so, then when a believer sins, we would say “Christ sinned.” Impossible! Christ in us bears **fruit of the Spirit**, not Sinai law. Galatians 5:22–23 says:  

> *“The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.”*  

Christ already kept the law perfectly for us. He now produces Spirit fruit in us, not feast-keeping.  

Paul’s feast-keeping is narrative, not doctrine.

## Chapter 8: Putting It All Together

At Sinai the feasts were covenant signs and prophetic shadows. To break them brought death.  

In the church age they are shadows only, non-binding, left to conscience.  

In the millennium they are royal statutes, bringing discipline, not death.  

In eternity they are forever fulfilled in God’s presence.  

God has moved the feasts across the ages—law, shadow, teaching, fulfillment—all so that Christ would be magnified in every step.

## Chapter 9: A Word of Encouragement

My friend, do not let anyone bind you under Sinai. Christ bore its curse and nailed it to the cross. He took away the first covenant so that He might establish the second.  

Ephesians 2:8–9 says:  

> *“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.”*  

1 Corinthians 5:8 shows how we truly keep the feast:  

> *“Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.”*  

This is how we live it now. Not shadows, but substance. Not law, but love. Not Sinai, but Spirit.  

So walk in freedom. Walk in love. Walk in the Spirit. Christ Himself is your feast, your Sabbath, your dwelling place, forever.
