# The Wisdom of God’s Pause: How the New Covenant Transforms the Feasts

The feasts of the Lord raise some of the most important questions in Scripture. Were they temporary rituals, or eternal commands? If the Sinai covenant has ended, why do we still see the feasts appear in prophecy? Why does Paul warn against judging others in them, and yet we read that he himself went up to Jerusalem for Pentecost?

The confusion is real. But the Bible is not silent. When we let God’s Word unfold in its own way, we find that the feasts trace the story of redemption itself:

- As covenant signs under Sinai.  
- As prophetic shadows pointing to Christ.  
- As non-binding teaching shadows in the church age.  
- As royal statutes in the coming kingdom.  
- And as eternal fulfillment in the new creation.  

Let us walk carefully, chapter by chapter, through this story.

## Chapter 1: The Feasts Under Sinai — Signs and Shadows

Leviticus 23:2 sets the stage: *“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘The feasts of the LORD, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, these are My feasts.’”*

The feasts were not Israel’s invention. They belonged to God, and He gave them to Israel as part of His covenant.

Exodus 31:13 explains: *“Surely My Sabbaths you shall keep, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.”*

The Sabbath was not just rest. It was a **sign**—a visible marker that Israel was God’s covenant people. Verse 17 repeats: *“It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever.”*

The seriousness of this covenant sign is shown in Numbers 15:32–36. A man gathered sticks on the Sabbath, and God commanded that he be stoned. Why so severe? Because breaking Sabbath meant breaking covenant. It was not simply breaking a moral law—it was shattering the covenant bond itself.

But the feasts were not only signs. They were also prophetic shadows. Paul writes in Colossians 2:16–17: *“So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.”*

See how this works? The feasts were covenant signs under Sinai, but they also pointed beyond themselves to Christ. The question, then, is this: if they were signs and shadows, what happened when Christ came?

## Chapter 2: How the Sinai Covenant Ended

The Bible does not leave us guessing about the nature of the covenant. Deuteronomy 4:13 says: *“So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone.”*

The Ten Commandments were not outside the covenant. They were the covenant. Deuteronomy 9:9 calls them “the tablets of the covenant.” To say the covenant ended is to say the law written on stone ended as covenant law.

The Sabbath itself proves this. Genesis 2 records God resting on the seventh day, but nowhere before Sinai are humans commanded to keep it. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob never observed a weekly Sabbath. The first time the Sabbath is commanded is Exodus 16.

There God said in verse 4: *“Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not.”*

The Sabbath here was both a blessing of rest and a covenant test. James 1:13 teaches: *“God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone.”* If Sabbath-breaking had always been sin, God could not have tested Israel with it. That shows it was introduced as covenant law at Sinai, not eternal moral law.

Paul calls the law on stone “the ministry of death.” In 2 Corinthians 3:7–11 he says it was glorious, but passing away. Hebrews 8:13 declares: *“In that He says, ‘A new covenant,’ He has made the first obsolete.”* Hebrews 10:9–10 adds: *“He takes away the first that He may establish the second.”*

Colossians 2:14 connects it to the cross: *“Having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us… He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.”* That is why Paul continues in verse 16: *“Therefore let no one judge you… in respect of a festival or a new moon or sabbaths.”*

Romans 4:15 explains: *“The law brings about wrath; for where there is no law there is no transgression.”* If Sabbath were still binding, failing to keep it would still be sin. But Paul says no one can judge you in it anymore.

Galatians 3:19 says: *“The law was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come.”* Verses 24–25 conclude: *“The law was our tutor to bring us to Christ… But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.”*

Even prophecy shows the change. At Sinai, Sabbath-breaking brought death. In Zechariah 14, refusal to keep Tabernacles brings no rain. That is correction, not covenant execution.

The verdict is clear: the Sinai covenant ended. The Ten Commandments written on stone, including the Sabbath, were nailed to the cross. The law fulfilled its purpose and was replaced by the New Covenant in Christ.

## Chapter 3: The Feasts in the Church Age — Shadows Still Working, Not Laws Still Binding

So where do the feasts stand now? Paul gives the answer. Colossians 2:16–17: *“Let no one judge you… regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.”*

The feasts remain shadows, still pointing forward in God’s timetable. But as covenant law they are finished.

Romans 14:5–6 affirms this freedom: *“One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it.”* If feast-keeping were still commanded, Paul could never write this.

The spring feasts already found fulfillment in Christ’s death, resurrection, and the giving of the Spirit at Pentecost. The fall feasts await their full realization at His return. They still work in prophecy, but they do not bind the conscience.

This balance is the wisdom of God. The feasts still teach, but they no longer condemn.

## Chapter 4: Why the Shift Was Necessary

Some might ask: why didn’t God simply erase the feasts entirely once Christ came? Why leave them as non-binding shadows instead of removing them altogether? The answer is that **the old covenant had to give way in a way that exalted Christ, opened the nations, and repositioned the badge of belonging from calendar to Spirit**.

**First, Christ must be the center, not the calendar.** Paul warns in Galatians 4:10–11, *“You observe days and months and seasons and years. I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain.”* Here Paul is not condemning every observance of a day; he is exposing the danger of trusting calendars for righteousness. When a believer leans on “days” to be right with God, the cross is emptied. The feasts could not remain as law, because law would rival the sufficiency of Christ.

**Second, the law functioned as a wall that had to be torn down so the gospel could run free to the nations.** Paul unfolds this in Ephesians 2:14–15: *“He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, having abolished in His flesh the law of commandments contained in ordinances.”*

Why call the law a “middle wall”? Because in the Jerusalem temple a literal stone barrier separated the Court of the Gentiles from the inner courts. Inscriptions warned that any foreigner who crossed would be responsible for his own death. That visible wall embodied the covenantal division: Israel inside, Gentiles outside. When Christ died, the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom, signaling that access to God would no longer be mediated by Sinai’s structures. Paul says Christ “abolished in His flesh the law of commandments” that sustained that dividing wall, *“to create in Himself one new man from the two”* (Ephesians 2:15). The result is **one people of God**, Jew and Gentile together, on equal footing—not because Gentiles adopted Israel’s calendar, but because both are reconciled to God *“through the cross”* (Ephesians 2:16).

See how the image works? The law separated; the cross united. The feasts as covenant law would have kept the wall standing. Christ’s death pulled it down so that the gospel could cross boundaries without demanding Sinai as the price of admission.

**Third, the badge of belonging had to move from calendar to Spirit and love.** Romans 8:9 teaches, *“If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.”* Jesus sets the badge in John 13:35: *“By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.”* Under Sinai, the badge was Sabbaths and feasts. Under Christ, the badge is the indwelling Spirit producing love. That is why Paul can grant liberty regarding days (Romans 14:5–6) while insisting that the mark of the church is Spirit and love (Romans 5:5; 1 Corinthians 13).

This is not confusion; it is wisdom. The covenant shifted so that Christ would be central, the nations would be welcomed without a wall, and the Spirit would replace the calendar as the sign of God’s people.

## Chapter 4a: Prophecies of the New Covenant — Already and Not Yet

Prophecy itself shows that God planned this shift as a **process**, not a single moment. Jeremiah 31:31–34 announces: *“Behold, the days are coming… when I will make a new covenant… not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers… I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts… They shall all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.”*

How does this unfold? **Already** in the church age, God writes His law on hearts by the Spirit (2 Corinthians 3:3; Hebrews 8:10). But **not yet** in full, because we still say to our neighbor, “Know the Lord.” The climax—*“they shall all know Me”*—awaits the kingdom, when Christ’s reign is visible and universal.

Ezekiel 11:19–20 complements this: *“I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them… that they may walk in My statutes… and they shall be My people, and I will be their God.”* The **new spirit** begins at Pentecost (Acts 2), but Ezekiel’s broader restoration looks beyond to a day when Israel and the nations are renewed under Messiah’s rule.

Jesus Himself modeled this “already / not yet” reading of prophecy. In Luke 4:18–21 He reads Isaiah 61:1–2, *“The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me… to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,”* and then He stops—He does **not** read, *“and the day of vengeance of our God.”* He closes the scroll and says, *“Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”* The first part (good news, release, the Lord’s favor) was fulfilled in His first coming; the “day of vengeance” awaits His return. Prophecy often comes in layered fulfillment: a true beginning now, a consummation later.

So it is with Jeremiah 31 and Ezekiel 11. The New Covenant is **in force now**—inaugurated by Christ’s blood and sealed by the Spirit—and it will be **consummated** in the kingdom, when *“they shall all know Me.”* This explains why feasts can be **non-binding shadows** now and **royal statutes** then, without contradiction: the same plan unfolding across stages.

## Chapter 5: Why They Return in the Millennium — Royal Statutes

This is why the feasts reappear in prophecy. Zechariah 14 says the nations will go up to Jerusalem to keep Tabernacles. Those who refuse will receive no rain, and Egypt a plague.

Why Tabernacles? Because it pictured God dwelling with His people in tents. In the millennium, Christ will dwell with the nations. The feast will serve as a teaching tool, not Sinai law but **royal statute**—the King’s public pedagogy for mortal nations.

Notice the change. Under Sinai, a man who broke Sabbath was stoned (Numbers 15). In the millennium, nations refusing Tabernacles are disciplined with lost blessing, not executed. Law gave way to kingdom discipline. This is not Sinai revived; it is Christ reigning, training the nations for joy.

But even this points further.

## Chapter 6: The Final Fulfillment in Eternity

Revelation 21:3 proclaims: *“Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people.”* Verse 22 says: *“But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.”*

See the progression? Sinai gave signs and shadows. The church age receives Spirit and freedom. The kingdom uses feasts as teaching. Eternity sees them fulfilled in God’s presence. No temple. No shadow. Christ Himself is the feast.

## Chapter 7: Did Paul Keep the Feasts? Narrative, Not Command

Some point to Paul’s travels as proof the feasts remain binding. Acts 18:21: *“I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem.”* Acts 20:16: *“He was hurrying to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the Day of Pentecost.”*

But what is Acts? It is **history**, not a law code. Luke writes narrative to show how the gospel spread. Saying Paul was in Jerusalem at Pentecost functions as a **time stamp** in a Jewish world still centered on the temple—like saying someone today was home for Christmas. It marks time and opportunity, not obligation.

Why did Paul go? He tells us. In 1 Corinthians 9:20, *“To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law (though I myself am not under the law), that I might win those who are under the law.”* Paul used feasts as **mission fields**, not as **mandates**. He stood in the synagogues and in the temple precincts because that is where the hearers gathered. This is evangelistic strategy, not covenant submission.

Could Paul require feast-keeping while also writing Colossians 2:16, *“Let no one judge you… regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths”*? He could not. The apostolic command is freedom from judgment in these shadows. If they were binding, failure would be sin and the church would rightly judge. Paul forbids that.

Some argue, “Christ in us keeps the feasts and Sabbaths.” But Scripture will not bear this. If “Christ in us” performs calendar observance, then whenever a believer fails or mis-keeps a day, we must say **Christ** failed. That is unthinkable. Christ is **sinless** (Hebrews 4:15; 1 Peter 2:22; 1 John 3:5). He already kept the law perfectly in His own life—*once for all*. Romans 5:19 declares, *“By one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous.”* Our righteousness rests on **His obedience**, not ours.

What, then, does Christ do in us now? He produces the **fruit of the Spirit**. Galatians 5:22–23: *“The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.”* Paul says in Romans 8:3–4 that God sent His Son, *“that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.”* Notice the wording: the law’s righteous requirement is fulfilled **in us** as we **walk by the Spirit**, not as we resume Sinai’s calendar.

This is why Paul will say, *“I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died in vain”* (Galatians 2:21), and, *“that I may be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ”* (Philippians 3:9). To make calendar obedience a ground or badge of righteousness is to set our works beside Christ’s finished work. Hebrews 10:14 says, *“By one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.”*

Therefore, Paul’s feast-keeping in Acts is **narrative**, not **normative**. It records opportunities to preach Christ, not commands to reenact Sinai. The New Covenant life is **Christ in us by the Spirit**, producing love—the true fulfillment the law pointed toward (Romans 13:8–10).

## Chapter 8: Putting It All Together

Trace the story:

- **At Sinai**, the feasts were covenant signs and prophetic shadows. To break them meant death.  
- **In the church age**, they remain shadows, but not law. They teach, but they do not bind.  
- **In the millennium**, they return as royal statutes. Nations that refuse lose blessing, but are not stoned.  
- **In eternity**, they are fulfilled in God’s presence. No temple, no shadow, only Christ tabernacling with His people forever.  

Each stage shows God’s wisdom—law, shadow, teaching, fulfillment—always moving toward and magnifying Christ.

## Chapter 9: A Word of Encouragement — How to Truly Keep the Feast

Paul gives us the clearest answer in 1 Corinthians 5:8: *“Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.”*

At first glance, that could sound like Paul is urging literal Passover observance. But look closely: he is not pointing them back to Sinai, but forward to Christ. He explains the symbols. The **old leaven** is not yeast in a kitchen—it is sin and hypocrisy. The **unleavened bread** is not flatbread—it is sincerity and truth. This is Paul’s inspired commentary: the feast is now kept **spiritually**, not ritually.

In other words, we do not keep Passover by removing yeast from our cupboards. We keep it by removing malice and wickedness from our hearts. We do not keep Unleavened Bread by eating flat loaves for seven days. We keep it by walking in genuine love and truth. That is how Paul tells the church to keep the feast.

### Growing in Grace and Knowledge Through the Shadows

Does this mean the feasts no longer matter? No—they still teach us God’s plan. Paul said they are “a shadow of things to come, but the substance is Christ” (Colossians 2:16–17). Shadows still have meaning, even if they cannot justify us. They help us grow in knowledge.

Peter exhorts in 2 Peter 3:18: *“But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.”* Grace keeps us from thinking feasts are required for salvation; knowledge keeps us from throwing away the lessons they contain. To study the feasts is to see God’s blueprint of redemption. Passover points to Christ’s sacrifice. Unleavened Bread points to sanctification. Firstfruits points to resurrection. Pentecost points to the Spirit’s outpouring. Trumpets points to His return. Atonement points to final cleansing. Tabernacles points to God dwelling with us.

Thus, even though we are not bound to them as law, we are wise to learn from them. They remain as teaching shadows, not saving works.

### Liberty Without Judgment

This is why Paul gives freedom on days. Romans 14:5–6 says: *“One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it.”*

Notice the balance: those who keep a feast to the Lord are accepted. Those who do not are equally accepted. Neither is to judge the other. Why? Because days are not the ground of righteousness—Christ is.

Colossians 2:16–17 says the same: *“Let no one judge you… regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come; but the substance is of Christ.”* No one has authority to condemn another over these shadows. Observance is free, non-observance is free, because the substance is Christ.

### The Danger of Turning Shadows Into Law

But here lies the danger: if we confuse shadow with substance, we rob Christ of His glory. Paul warns in Galatians 5:4: *“You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.”* To keep the feasts as if they were law is to say the cross was not enough.

This is why Paul says in Galatians 2:21: *“If righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died in vain.”* To treat feast-keeping as obligatory righteousness is to declare Christ’s death unnecessary. That is why Paul was so strong with the Galatians. It is not that the feasts were bad—they were God’s own shadows. But when someone insisted they were binding, they had turned the shadow into a rival savior.

So Paul draws the line. You may freely observe the feasts as teaching shadows, but never as binding law. To do so is to deny the sufficiency of Christ.

### True Feast-Keeping in the New Covenant

So how do we keep the feast today? Not by ritual calendar law, but by living in Christ. Paul has already told us: we keep it with sincerity and truth. We keep it by walking in the Spirit, for *“if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law”* (Galatians 5:18).

Every day we put away the leaven of sin, every day we walk in sincerity and truth, we are keeping the feast in the way God intended under the New Covenant. This is not less—it is more. It is the reality to which the ritual pointed.

And this is why Christ’s yoke is easy and His burden is light (Matthew 11:30). The feasts were burdensome when they condemned, but joyful when they are seen as fulfilled in Christ. We are free, not lawless; free to learn, not bound to shadows.

### The Encouragement

So take courage. If you are in Christ, you are already keeping the true feast. You are unleavened because *“Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us”* (1 Corinthians 5:7). You grow in grace and knowledge by studying the shadows, but you live in freedom because you walk in the Spirit.

The shadows still teach, but they no longer bind. To mistake them for law is to dishonor Christ. To learn from them as wisdom is to honor Him.

So let us keep the feast—not with calendars and courts of Sinai, but with sincerity, truth, and the Spirit’s fruit. For Christ Himself is our Passover, our Pentecost, our Tabernacles. In Him all shadows find their end.
