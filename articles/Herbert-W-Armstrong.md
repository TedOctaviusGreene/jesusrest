# Our Respect and Acknowledgment of Truths Herbert W. Armstrong Helped Restore

It is easy, in the heat of correcting error, to forget to acknowledge truth. But fairness requires us to say plainly: there were truths Herbert W. Armstrong boldly taught that were not widely accepted in Christianity, and for these we give thanks. We are not his disciples — we follow Christ. > Yet it is God’s way to use weak and imperfect servants to shine light on truths that others have overlooked. Armstrong was wrong about the Sabbath and holy days as binding law, but that does not mean he was wrong about everything. And in certain areas, his voice was a trumpet against the tide of tradition.

## Born Again — Begotten Now, Born at the Resurrection

One of those truths concerns what it means to be *“born again.”* Most of Christianity uses the phrase loosely to describe the moment of conversion. But Armstrong was right to notice that the Greek word often translated “born” can also mean *“begotten.”*  

John writes, *“Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God”* (1 John 5:1, YLT). Peter says, *“You have been begotten again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead”* (1 Peter 1:3).  

We are not yet spirit beings. We are begotten now, as children in the womb, awaiting the day when this mortal puts on immortality (1 Corinthians 15:53). Jesus told Nicodemus, *“That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit”* (John 3:6). That has not happened to us yet, for we are still flesh and blood. But it will happen in the resurrection, when we are changed and born of spirit. Armstrong stood courageously for this truth, and he was right.

## The Trinity — Not a Biblical Teaching

Another truth Armstrong stood against was the Trinity doctrine. He insisted, and rightly, that the Bible does not teach one God in three persons. Instead, Scripture reveals a family relationship: the Father and the Son, and the Spirit as God’s power and presence, not a separate person.  

Jesus Himself prayed, *“This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent”* (John 17:3). Paul wrote, *“There is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things”* (1 Corinthians 8:6). Armstrong was mocked for rejecting the Trinity, but here again, he was standing on Scripture.

## The Coming Kingdom of God and the Resurrection

Armstrong also proclaimed the Kingdom of God as a real government to be established at Christ’s return. He emphasized the coming resurrection — that the dead are asleep until Christ raises them, and that the hope of believers is not floating to heaven but reigning with Christ.  

Paul says, *“The dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air”* (1 Thessalonians 4:16–17).  

This was not a popular teaching in mainstream churches, which often spiritualized the Kingdom. But Armstrong’s focus on the resurrection, and the hope of ruling with Christ, was squarely biblical.

## Clean and Unclean Meats

Armstrong also defended the wisdom of the dietary laws. While these were covenant obligations for Israel, they were not arbitrary. God gave them for a reason, because He is a God of wisdom and love.  

Science itself has shown the dangers in many of the animals God called unclean. While the New Covenant does not bind these food laws as sin if ignored, they remain wise. As Paul said, *“All things are lawful, but not all things are helpful”* (1 Corinthians 10:23). A Christian may freely eat, but one who honors God’s design will often find blessing in walking wisely.

## Our Balance

So we say openly: Armstrong recovered truths that much of Christianity had lost sight of. We do not follow him, for he was wrong about many things. But we give honor where honor is due. His warnings against the Trinity, his insistence on the hope of the resurrection and the Kingdom of God, his teaching that we are now begotten but not yet born of spirit — in these things he was standing against powerful tides of tradition.  

Yet Armstrong erred gravely when he bound Christians under the Sabbath and holy days as law. The New Testament does not make them sin if observed, nor sin if not observed. They were covenant signs for Israel, shadows pointing to Christ, but not binding upon the nations or upon those in Christ. The Spirit now defines holiness, not a calendar.

## Exhortation

The lesson for us is humility. No man has all truth, save Christ alone. God may use a flawed man to sound a trumpet, but we must always test by Scripture. Armstrong found real truths — but also stumbled into grievous error.  

> Let us then acknowledge the truths of the Bible, while rejecting the errors of men, and stand together on the foundation that cannot be shaken: **Jesus Christ crucified, risen, and coming again to bring His Kingdom.**
