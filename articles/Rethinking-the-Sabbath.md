# Was the Prohibition to Work on the Sabbath Observed After Jesus Instituted the New Covenant?

## Understanding the Old Covenant and Its End: A Loving Response to Church of God Beliefs

Before we can evaluate whether Christians must keep the Sabbath, we need to understand the covenant under which the Sabbath was given—and why such a covenant was necessary in the first place.  

The God of Scripture is both unimaginably holy and deeply loving. He longs to dwell among His people, yet His blazing holiness cannot tolerate sin (Ex 19:16-21). To protect sinful humans from being consumed by His glory, the Lord often revealed Himself through *“the angel of the LORD,”* a messenger who veiled His presence (Ex 3:2; Judg 6:12–23). The law and sacrificial system were gracious, provisional measures that allowed a holy God to live among a sinful nation. They taught Israel that sin separates us from God and that blood must be shed to cover guilt (Lev 17:11). The Sinai covenant therefore functioned as a tutor, revealing both God’s holiness and our need for a mediator—and foreshadowing the remedy that would come through the Messiah.

The covenant made at Sinai was not a loose collection of moral principles but a national constitution binding Israel to God. Moses read *“all the words of the Lord and all the judgments”* to the people, who responded, *“All that the Lord has said we will do”* (Ex 24:3). He then took the book of the covenant, sprinkled it with blood, and said:

> *“This is the blood of the covenant which the Lord has made with you according to all these words.”*  
> — Exodus 24:7-8  

The covenant included the Ten Commandments written on stone as well as statutes and ordinances governing civil and ceremonial life. James later summarised its integrated nature:  

> *“Whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all.”*  
> — James 2:10  

Under that covenant the commands and statutes were inseparable: violating any part breached the whole. For example, an Israelite who gathered sticks on the Sabbath was stoned to death (Num 15:32-36), and one who secretly worshipped other gods was likewise executed (Deut 17:2-5). The covenant was a single package—its moral commands and its ritual prohibitions carried the same weight. You cannot arbitrarily lift one practice from this covenant while discarding others without breaking the agreement itself.

The covenant’s enforcement relied on a Levitical priesthood and a temple system. If an Israelite sinned, he brought sacrifices to the tabernacle where priests mediated between him and God. The high priest entered the Most Holy Place once a year on the Day of Atonement, separated from the people by a heavy veil. This entire system—the tablets of stone, the priesthood and the sacrificial rituals—stood or fell together. To “abolish” one part while retaining another was impossible.

Because this covenant was indivisible, its signs were entrusted to a specific people rather than to all humanity. Exodus 31 underscores that the weekly Sabbath was given as a sign between the Lord and *“the children of Israel”* throughout their generations (Exod 31:16–17). It reminded Israel that the Lord had sanctified them and delivered them from Egyptian bondage (Deut 5:15).  

Scripture never commands Gentile nations to rest on Israel’s Sabbath; instead, Isaiah foresees foreigners willingly joining themselves to the Lord and choosing to keep His Sabbath because they love His name (Isa 56:6–7). Under the old covenant, however, violating this sign was as serious as idolatry: gathering sticks on the Sabbath or secretly serving other gods incurred the death penalty (Num 15:32–36; Deut 17:2–5). You cannot detach one statute from that covenant and carry it into the new covenant without tearing the covenant itself.

## Why Did God End the Covenant?

Because it was preparatory. The law functioned as a guardian to lead Israel to Christ (Gal 3:24). Its priesthood, sacrifices and holy-day calendar were foreshadows pointing toward a greater reality. To grasp what that reality is, the letter to the Hebrews invites us to ponder *rest.*

In Hebrews 3–4 the author develops this theme with carefully chosen words. The primary noun **katapausis** means “rest” — not merely ceasing, but refreshment, satisfaction, a settled peace. The Septuagint uses the word this way in Exodus 33:14: *“My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest [katapauseō].”* It is the same word used when God speaks of His own dwelling satisfaction: *“What is the place of My rest [katapauseōs]?”* (Acts 7:49).  

In Hebrews it refers to God’s rest, as well as the rest Joshua never gave Israel in Canaan (Heb 4:4, 8–10). The related verb **katapauō** means “to cause to rest” (Heb 4:8). A second noun, **sabbatismos**, appears only in Hebrews 4:9: *“There remains therefore a rest for the people of God.”* Together these words show that the Sabbath, the Promised Land, and even the seventh day of creation were all anticipating something richer.

Israel first learned rest at Sinai. God commanded:  

> *“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day [shabbat, literally seventh] is the Sabbath of the LORD your God. In it you shall do no work.”*  
> — Exodus 20:8–10  

Notice the distinction: the word Sabbath itself simply means *seventh*; it is not the Hebrew word for *rest.* The Greek translation of Exodus 20 reflects the same, using *sabbaton* for Sabbath (seventh) and *katapausis* when God adds His own rest to it (cf. Heb 4:4). The day by itself was simply seventh in sequence. What gave it meaning was that God placed His own rest upon it.

This pattern is clear from creation:  

> *“And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested [katapausen in Greek] on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.”*  
> — Genesis 2:2 (LXX)  

God did not rest because He was tired, but because He was satisfied. After each day He declared His work *“good,”* and when He finished He delighted in it. The seventh day became holy not because of anything inherent in the number seven, but because God set it apart as the day He attached His rest to.  

Holiness in the old covenant was always something God conferred, not something inherent in the object or day itself. The tabernacle, the altar, the priesthood, even the vessels were *“made holy”* because God set them apart for a purpose. When that covenant ended, their holiness passed away with it. So it was with the Sabbath: God made the seventh day holy for Israel, but that holiness pointed forward to something greater.

Israel was reminded of this again in Deuteronomy:  

> *“And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out… therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.”*  
> — Deuteronomy 5:15  

Ceasing from labor was a declaration of freedom. They were no longer Pharaoh’s property. Anyone who never pauses is a slave to something, whether an ancient taskmaster or the modern idol of overwork. The Sabbath in Israel’s story was a celebration of liberation.

And yet Hebrews makes clear that these shadows did not bestow ultimate rest. Those who hardened their hearts *“could not enter [God’s] rest”* because of unbelief (Heb 3:18–19). The Sabbath law gave them a weekly pause, and Canaan gave them a homeland, but both were temporary signposts. The true **katapausis**—the rest of God Himself—was still waiting.

## Why Joshua Couldn’t Give Rest

But even after entering the land, Israel still lacked this true sabbatismos rest. Hebrews 4:8 explains:  

> *“If Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day.”*  

Centuries after the conquest of Canaan, Psalm 95 was still warning God’s people not to miss His rest.  

And what “day” was David speaking of? Hebrews quotes it repeatedly:  

> *“Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”*  
> — Hebrews 3:7; 3:15; 4:7  

The Spirit deliberately says **Today** — not *“the seventh day,”* not a calendar observance. The message is that the real day of entering God’s rest is the day you hear the gospel and believe in Christ.

The conclusion is unavoidable: the weekly Sabbath and the land were not the final rest. They were shadows pointing forward. The true **sabbatismos** is entered any day, whenever a heart turns in faith to Jesus.  

> *“There remains therefore a rest [sabbatismos] for the people of God.”*  
> — Hebrews 4:9  

This *“rest that remains”* is not the weekly Sabbath Israel already had, but something greater. Just as Jesus magnified the law—exposing that hatred is murder in seed form and lust is adultery in seed form—here the Sabbath itself is magnified. Its completion is found in Christ, who offers rest that is not bound to a calendar but is entered every day by faith.  

Thus the true **katapausis**—the rest of God Himself—is fully expressed in the **sabbatismos,** the *“rest that remains.”* It is the gospel rest, the present satisfaction and refreshment of ceasing from our own works and trusting in Christ’s finished work, while also looking forward to the millennial and eternal rest in His kingdom.

## Entering by Faith

Hebrews 4:10 continues:  

> *“For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.”*  

But how is that rest entered? The answer has already been given:  

> *“Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it. For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it. For we who have believed do enter that rest.”*  
> — Hebrews 4:1–3  

The rest is entered by faith in the gospel. Israel had Sabbath days and Canaan, but without faith they never had rest. Believers today cease from their own works when they trust Christ instead of themselves. On the cross He cried:  

> *“It is finished.”*  
> — John 19:30  

His finished work—not ours—is the foundation of the true rest.

## Present and Future

The gospel rest is both *“now”* and *“not yet.”* It is entered today by faith in Christ, but it also looks ahead to the millennial reign of Jesus and beyond that to the eternal rest at God’s throne:  

> *“Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool. What house will you build Me? Or what is the place of My rest?”*  
> — Acts 7:49  

This is why Hebrews 4 suddenly shifts to the penetrating power of Scripture. God’s word is *“living and powerful… sharper than any two-edged sword… a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”* It slices through our self-deception and exposes our motivations. The author continues:  

> *“There is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.”*  

In other words, we will never enter into this rest until we admit our spiritual nakedness. Like Adam and Eve, we sew fig leaves of legalism, dead works, good works or excuses to cover our shame. The law reveals that those coverings are threadbare.  

When we finally stand exposed before God—when His word shows us that our hearts are restless because we are trying to be our own saviors—then we can rest in the righteousness of Christ, our High Priest who sympathizes with our weakness and brings us into God’s presence.

## The New Covenant Instituted by Jesus

Jesus Himself announced that He was instituting something new. At the Last Supper He declared:  

> *“This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you.”*  
> — Luke 22:20 (cf. 1 Cor 11:25)  

With the new covenant came a new priesthood (Heb 7:11-14) and a new law written on hearts rather than stone (Heb 8:10). The author of Hebrews notes that in speaking of a new covenant God *“has made the first obsolete.”*  

Paul, reflecting on the tablets of stone, calls that ministry *“the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones”* and declares that its fading glory has been surpassed by the ministry of the Spirit (2 Cor 3:7-11). Notice that he refers specifically to the law written on stones—the Ten Commandments. The moral truths behind those commandments remain valid, but the ritual prohibition of working on the Sabbath was a shadow that has been fulfilled.  

Human goodness and law-keeping could never make anyone right with God because *“all have sinned and fall short”* (Rom 3:23). We need a better covenant that forgives sin and transforms hearts. Scripture teaches that a righteousness apart from the law has been revealed, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe (Rom 3:21-22). Through His death and resurrection, God *“made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him”* (2 Cor 5:21).  

When we trust Christ, His righteousness is credited to us and we receive the Holy Spirit, who writes God’s law on our hearts (Gal 3:14; Heb 10:15-16).

In other words, the paradox revealed under the old covenant—how a holy God could be among sinful people—is resolved in Jesus. He bore our iniquities and paid the penalty that the law demanded, and He imputes His righteousness to everyone who believes. Because He has cleansed us, God’s own Spirit can dwell within us without consuming us (John 14:17; 1 Cor 6:19). This is the heart of the new covenant: not merely external rules but an inner transformation by grace.

He writes that believers now serve in *“newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter”* (Rom 7:6). Christ’s death ended the old covenant in full and confirmed the new; at that moment *“the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom”* (Matt 27:51). God ripped open the barrier separating humanity from His presence, signaling the end of the old system.  

No longer did a priesthood stand between the believer and God; we have *“boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus”* (Heb 10:19). This access is possible because God imputes Christ’s righteousness to those who believe and indwells them by His Spirit (Heb 10:14-15).

With the inauguration of the new covenant the sign is no longer a holy day but a holy Person. Jesus took bread and wine and said:  

> *“This cup is the new covenant in My blood.”*  
> — Luke 22:20  

Paul explains that God seals believers with the Holy Spirit as a guarantee (2 Cor 1:22; Eph 1:13). Circumcision of the heart by the Spirit, not circumcision of the flesh, marks out the people of God (Rom 2:29). Our identity is no longer tethered to a day on the calendar but to the indwelling Spirit who unites us to Christ. Faith in Jesus, demonstrated in baptism and the Lord’s Supper, is the sign of belonging to the new covenant community.  

To insist on retaining the old sign—mandatory Sabbath-keeping—while embracing Christ is like wearing a wedding ring from a previous marriage after you have already married someone else. The ring might remind you of the past, but it no longer defines your covenant status.

## The Sabbath’s Place in the Old and New Covenants

Understanding this dramatic shift has profound implications for Sabbath observance. If the old covenant was a package deal—law, priesthood, sacrifices and all—then its conclusion means that its signs and rituals no longer bind God’s people. The covenant written on stone served its purpose until Christ fulfilled it. When He cried *“It is finished!”* (*tetelestai*), He proclaimed that God’s redemptive plan had been brought to completion (John 19:30).  

To continue enforcing the old covenant’s rituals is like insisting that a canceled contract remains in force after a new agreement has been signed. Armstrong and many in the Churches of God often cite Matthew 5:17-19 to argue that Jesus made the law more binding. They interpret *“fulfill”* (*plēroō*) as “fill up” or “reinforce” the commandments. Yet in Matthew’s Gospel the verb *plēroō* consistently means *“bring to fulfillment”* or *“complete”* (Matt 1:22; 2:15).  

Jesus did not come to strengthen the old covenant but to accomplish the very things to which it pointed (Luke 24:44). When He said *“till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled,”* the phrase *“till all is fulfilled”* (Greek: *heōs an panta genētai*) signals the law’s goal. On the cross He declared, *“It is finished,”* indicating that the prophetic and sacrificial requirements were satisfied.  

While the moral call to love God and neighbor continues (Matt 22:37-40), the ritual code—including the prohibition against working on the Sabbath—has been set aside (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14).

## Armstrong’s Claim and the Sabbath’s Place

Herbert W. Armstrong was correct in noting that the Sabbath predates Sinai. Genesis 2 records that God ceased from His creative work, blessed the seventh day and sanctified it. Jesus affirmed that *“the Sabbath was made for man”* (Mark 2:27)—a gift for humanity rather than a burden
