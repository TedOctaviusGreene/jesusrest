# Are Christians Still Under the Law? Questions and Answers on the Ten Commandments, Sin, and New Covenant Freedom

Many believers quietly wrestle with the same questions: **Are Christians still under the Ten Commandments? If we’re dead to the law, can we still sin? What is the “law of Christ”? Can a real Christian be unloving and still be saved?** This Q&A walks slowly through those questions using Scripture alone—showing how the cross ended the old covenant, what sin is now for those in Christ, how righteousness is no longer written on stone but in our hearts by the Spirit, and why our standing with God rests on **Jesus’ finished work**, not on our fluctuating obedience. If you’ve struggled with legalism, fear of losing salvation, or confusion about law versus grace, these answers are meant to help you see the difference between the **law of Sinai** and the **law of Christ**, and to rest in the One who keeps His promises even when we stumble.

  <summary><strong>Q1 — Are Christians really dead to every law, regulation, ordinance, statute, judgment, and command?</strong></summary>

### **Q: Are Christians dead to every law, regulation, ordinance, statute, judgment, and command that Christ fulfilled?**

Yes. Absolutely yes. And this is not a reckless claim—this is the very heart and scandal and glory of the New Covenant. Scripture does not whisper this; it shouts it. **We died to the law.** Not to part of it. Not to the ceremonial portion only. Not to the “hard parts.” **To the whole thing as a covenant of obligation, performance, and identity.**

Paul says it as plainly as human language can carry:

> **“You also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ”**  
— *Romans 7:4*

> **“For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.”**  
— *Romans 6:14*

> **“If you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.”**  
— *Galatians 5:18*

> **“Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.”**  
— *Romans 10:4*

A law that a man has died to has **no power over him**. A law that has been fulfilled has **no remaining claim**. A covenant that has ended cannot be revived without **denying the cross**.

And why did God do this? Because **the law could never make anyone better**. It could diagnose the disease, but it could not heal it. It could expose sin, but it could not remove it. It could command love, but it could not produce it.

Paul reveals the divine purpose:

> **“The law was added… until the Seed should come.”**  
— *Galatians 3:19*

Until. A word of divine finality. A clock that ran out. A covenant that reached its destination. A shadow that disappeared at sunrise.

The law was not God’s final gift. It was His **scaffolding**, erected temporarily around a construction site. When Christ came—and in His flesh fulfilled every demand ever written—the scaffolding did not become the building. It came down. It yielded to the finished structure.

> **“We are no longer under a tutor.”**  
— *Galatians 3:25*

Something real ended.

And something far more glorious began.

Christ did not merely remove a legal system—He **installed Himself** in the place of the law. What tablets once demanded, **the Vine now produces in His branches**. What once condemned from stone now **creates from within by Spirit**. What once separated now **indwells**. What once strained by duty now **overflows by delight**.

The reason Christians become better is not because they now keep what they once broke. That is still impossible. The reason Christians become better is because **the One who kept it now lives His life through them**.

> **“It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.”**  
— *Galatians 2:20*

This is the miracle that legalism cannot fathom and fear-driven religion cannot tolerate:  
**External regulation has been replaced by internal transformation.**  
**Commands carved in stone have been replaced by Christ carved into hearts.**  
**Rules that demanded love have been replaced by the Spirit who produces it.**

And all of those laws that once separated Jew from Gentile—food laws, holy days, rituals, washings, festivals, temple access, circumcision—were never laws of love in themselves, but laws of **separation**, guarding a holy God from dwelling with sinful man.

Christ ended them not because they were evil, but because **they had fulfilled their purpose**: they carried us to the one place where holiness and humanity finally met—**in the body of Jesus Christ**.

He did not come to hand us a better version of the law.  
He came to **become everything the law required**.  
He came to **fulfill every separation by becoming the bridge**.  
He came to **stand where no man could stand**—approved by the Father as the true Man.  
He came so that **His righteousness would be ours**, not earned, but inherited.

And now, everything that once condemned us has nothing left to say.

> **“There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.”**  
— *Romans 8:1*

If we are dead to the law, the law cannot sit in judgment over us.
If we are alive in Christ, Christ alone defines us.
If righteousness is a gift, then boasting dies.
If holiness is His work, then fear dies.
If love is His fruit, then striving dies.

We do not become better by trying harder.  
We become better by **staying near the One who already fulfilled everything**.

We are not improved by our performance.  
We are **transformed by His presence**.

We do not climb.  
We **abide**.

We do not earn.  
We **receive**.

We do not maintain salvation.  
**We rest in the One who maintains us.**

And that is why Christianity is not a life lived under rules—it is a life lived **inside a Person**.

  <summary><strong>Q2 — If believers are dead to the law, can they still sin?</strong></summary>

### **Q: If Christians are dead to the law, can they still sin? And if so, what is sin now?**

Yes. Believers can still sin. The New Covenant never teaches that Christians become incapable of sinning in this flesh. It teaches something far more shocking and liberating: **that sin is no longer imputed to the believer**, because the law that once defined and condemned sin has been removed from over them forever.

This is not opinion. This is Scripture, in language so explicit that only fear or pride could deny it.

> **“Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.”**  
— *Romans 4:8*

Not might not.  
Not sometimes does not.  
**Will not.** A divine refusal.

Why? Because God is pretending we are righteous?  
No — because we **are** righteous in Christ.

> **“For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.”**  
— *Hebrews 10:14*

Perfected forever — while still being sanctified.  
A finished identity growing into a finished destiny.  
Justified fully, sanctified progressively.

So if sin is no longer imputed, does sin matter?  
Yes — and more than ever.  
But it matters differently.

Sin is no longer a legal crime that threatens our standing with God.  
Sin is now a relational contradiction to the love Christ is producing within us.

Under the old covenant, sin was **breaking the law**.  
Under the New Covenant:

> **Sin is violating the law of Christ — the law of love.**

Jesus gave no list of regulations.  
He gave one command that contains the whole will of God:

> **“Love one another as I have loved you.”**  
— *John 13:34*

And Paul echoes with unmistakable clarity:

> **“Love is the fulfillment of the law.”**  
— *Romans 13:10*

So what is sin now?

**Sin is anything unloving.**  
Not un-Sinai.  
Un-loving.

Anything that refuses Christ’s love, anything that contradicts love, anything that wounds instead of heals — that is sin. And when we do it, it does not expel us from God, nor change our identity, nor place us back under condemnation.

Instead, the Spirit convicts us — not to terrify us, but to **restore us**.  
Not to shame us, but to **reshape us**.  
Not to threaten us, but to **transform us**.

Because we do not walk according to fear, but according to relationship.

> **“For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of adoption…”**  
— *Romans 8:15*

The legalist fears sin because he believes sin brings condemnation.  
The Christian hates sin because it opposes love.

The legalist fights sin to earn acceptance.  
The Christian resists sin because **he is accepted**.

The legalist fears losing salvation.  
The Christian marvels that salvation can never be lost.

The legalist obeys externally.  
The Christian is transformed internally.

This distinction is everything.  
The law demanded righteousness and condemned failure.  
The Spirit **produces righteousness and uses failure** to deepen humility.

And yes — Christians still fall short. Sometimes terribly. Sometimes repeatedly. Sometimes shamefully. But Scripture answers that question too:

> **“Where sin abounded, grace abounded much more.”**  
— *Romans 5:20*

This is not permission; it is power.  
It is not freedom to sin; it is freedom from the tyranny of sin.  
Grace does not increase sin — **grace kills sin at the root.**

> **“For sin shall not have dominion over you.”**  
— *Romans 6:14*

Not because we are strong — but because **Christ lives in us**.

If sin could condemn the believer, then Christ’s sacrifice failed.
If sin could remove righteousness, then righteousness wasn’t a gift.
If sin could break union, then union wasn’t real.

But Christ **finished the work**.

We do not stay close to God by trying harder.  
We stay close to God by **trusting deeper**.

Sin is no longer the thing that threatens our standing.
Sin is now simply the thing that Christ is removing from our hearts through love, over time, by His Spirit, as He grows His own fruit within us.

We are not afraid of sin.
We are not defined by sin.
We do not hide sin.

We bring it into the light where **grace transforms weakness into worship**.

  <summary><strong>Q3 — If sin still exists, what counts as sin now?</strong></summary>

### **Q: Seeing that believers can still sin, what actually constitutes sin now? How do we define it, recognize it, and understand it in the New Covenant?**

Under the Old Covenant, sin was defined legally: **sin was breaking the law of Moses.** It was a violation of commands written on stone, external, enforced by penalties and distance and fear. But that covenant—and therefore that definition—**ended at the cross**.

Paul says it directly and decisively:

> **“Where there is no law, there is no transgression.”**  
— *Romans 4:15*

If the believer is not under the law, then sin can no longer be defined as violation of Sinai. If the law has ended, then sin must have a new definition, a New Covenant definition. And Scripture reveals exactly what that is:

> **“Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.”**  
— *Romans 13:10*

> **“For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”**  
— *Galatians 5:14*

> **“This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.”**  
— *John 15:12*

The law of Christ is **not Sinai revised**, but **love revealed**. It is not a list. It is a life. It is not written with ink. It is written on hearts. It is not demanded—it is **produced** by the Spirit within us.

So what is sin now?

**Sin is anything that contradicts love — the love of Christ.**  
Not un-Sabbath  
Not un-clean foods  
Not un-Holy Days  
Not un-circumcision  
Not un-regulation  
Not un-tradition  
But **un-loving**.

Sin is refusing love.  
Sin is wounding when we could heal.  
Sin is withholding mercy.  
Sin is elevating self over another.  
Sin is unbelief that refuses to rest in Christ.  
Sin is pride that rejects grace.  
Sin is anything that does not flow from **the Vine** through the branches.

Paul gives the New Covenant definition in one sentence:

> **“Whatever is not from faith is sin.”**  
— *Romans 14:23*

Not whatever is not from Moses.  
Not whatever is not from Sinai.  
Not whatever is not from regulation.  
**Whatever is not from faith.**

Faith works through love:

> **“For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.”**  
— *Galatians 5:6*

So if the fruit on the branch is not **faith expressing itself through love**, it is sin — **even if it looks holy**.

A man may keep the Sabbath and sin doing it.  
A man may refuse Christmas and sin doing it.  
A man may be morally strict and sin doing it.  
Why?  
Because **sin is not measured by outward performance but by inward posture**.

If righteousness could be measured by externals, the Pharisees would have been the holiest men ever to walk the earth. Yet Jesus said they were full of dead men’s bones — because love was absent.

Anything that looks holy without love is sin.
Anything that looks messy but is driven by love fulfills the law more perfectly than tablets ever could.

Because the New Covenant life is not **what we do**, but **who lives in us**.

Paul says it with terrifying simplicity:

> **“If I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.”**  
— *1 Corinthians 13:3*

Meaning:  
**A man can die for God and still sin doing it if love is not the source.**

Love is not the reward of holiness — **love is holiness itself**.  
Love is not the result of obedience — **love is obedience**.  
Love is not the evidence that we have tried hard enough — **love is the fruit that Christ grows**.

So what is sin now?

**Sin is anything Christ Himself would not do in us.**  
Anything that is not love.  
Anything that is not faith.  
Anything that does not reflect the character of the One we are united to.

The miracle?  
Even when we sin now — **it is not imputed**.

Why?  
Because the blood has answered the law forever.  
Because righteousness is a gift that cannot be returned.  
Because justification is finished and irreversible.  
Because Christ does not un-adopt His children every time they stumble.

Grace does not minimize sin — **it removes its power**.  
Grace does not excuse sin — **it ends condemnation**.  
Grace does not harden hearts — **it melts them**.

And slowly — sometimes painfully slowly — Christ forms His love in us. He bears the fruit. He shapes the heart. He prunes the branch. He finishes what He started.

> **“He who began a good work in you will complete it.”**  
— *Philippians 1:6*

We are not what we were.  
We are not yet what we will be.  
But we stand forever perfect in the righteousness of Christ — even while He builds the reality of that righteousness into our experience.

This is the Gospel legalism cannot bear, but sinners fall in love with:  
**We are changed by love, not by law.**  
**We grow through rest, not through striving.**  
**We become holy by union, not by discipline.**  
**We obey because we are loved, not to be loved.**

Christ is the Author and Finisher.  
We are the beloved, learning slowly how to love like Him.

  <summary><strong>Q4 — Can Christians judge one another?</strong></summary>

### **Q: Can Christians judge one another? What does it mean to discern fruit but not condemn?**

No — Christians are not called to sit in judgment over one another. Judgment belongs to Christ alone. Scripture could not be clearer: the believer has been removed from condemnation forever, and no Christian has the authority to place another believer back under what Christ has already abolished.

> **“Who are you to judge another man’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.”**  
— *Romans 14:4*

God will make him stand — not discipline will make him stand, not accountability structures will make him stand, not peer evaluation will make him stand. **God Himself**. Judgment is not our assignment. **Love is.**

Jesus warned plainly:

> **“Judge not, that you be not judged.”**  
— *Matthew 7:1*

He was not telling Christians to avoid moral clarity — He was telling them to avoid taking the seat that belongs to God alone. To judge is to **condemn**, to **weigh someone’s standing before God**, to **evaluate their righteousness as if we were the court**. And Scripture slams that door shut:

> **“There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.”**  
— *Romans 8:1*

Condemnation ended at the cross. The gavel fell. The verdict was declared. The record was nailed to wood and rolled in blood. **Case closed for eternity.** And if Christ will not condemn His own, how dare His people do what He refuses to do?

So if we cannot judge, what does it mean when Jesus said:

> **“You will know them by their fruits”?**  
— *Matthew 7:16*

He did not say **“you will judge them by their fruits.”**  
He did not say **“you will condemn them by their fruits.”**  
He did not say **“you will evaluate their salvation by their fruits.”**

He said **“you will know”** — meaning you will perceive, recognize, understand. **Discernment, not condemnation.** Fruit is not evidence to scrutinize others; fruit is the natural overflow of abiding in Christ.

Jesus does not say, “produce fruit to prove your salvation.”  
He says:

> **“He who abides in Me bears much fruit.”**  
— *John 15:5*

Fruit is not a test we pass.  
Fruit is a miracle we cannot manufacture.  
Fruit does not reveal our skill — it reveals **His life**.

So what about someone who isn’t bearing much fruit? Someone who seems unloving, inconsistent, immature, messy, or still trapped in old patterns?

The legalist declares them suspect.
The Pharisee labels them false.
The self-righteous withdraws from them.

But Scripture says something terrifyingly beautiful:

> **“We who are strong ought to bear with the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves.”**  
— *Romans 15:1*

Weak believers are not proof of false conversion — they are proof of the patience of God. Growth is slow by divine design. Sanctification is not instant because **instant perfection would produce pride**. And God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.

No Christian ever arrived overnight.  
If perfection were immediate, we would boast — and be damned by arrogance.

That is why Paul says:

> **“Why do you judge your brother? … For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.”**  
— *Romans 14:10*

There is a Judge.  
It is not us.  
We will all stand before Him — but not to decide salvation. Salvation is settled. We will stand **as children receiving reward**, not criminals awaiting sentencing.

So is the unloving Christian still a Christian?

Yes — if salvation depended on our performance, no one would be saved. It is Christ’s workmanship, not ours.

> **“It is God who works in you both to will and to do.”**  
— *Philippians 2:13*

He produces the fruit.  
He prunes the branch.  
He carries the child.  
He completes the work.

Our failures are not evidence that we are lost — they are evidence that we are **still being shaped**. He delays visible fruit to keep us humble, dependent, broken in gratitude rather than hardened in pride.

The strongest trees grow the slowest.  
The deepest roots break the hardest ground.  
The most magnificent oaks endure the fiercest storms.

To judge is to kill what God is nurturing.  
To love is to water what He is growing.

So what then is our calling toward one another?

**Not judge — but restore.**  
**Not condemn — but carry.**  
**Not inspect — but intercede.**

> **“If anyone is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted.”**  
— *Galatians 6:1*

Not expose.  
Not shame.  
Not withdraw.  
**Restore.**

For the Judge we serve is also the One who said:

> **“I will never leave you nor forsake you.”**  
— *Hebrews 13:5*

And neither should we.

  <summary><strong>Q5 — Is a Christian who acts unlovingly still a real Christian?</strong></summary>

### **Q: Is a Christian still a Christian if he appears unloving, weak, immature, or fails repeatedly?**

Yes. A thousand times yes. A believer does not cease to be a believer because he fails, stumbles, collapses, struggles with the flesh, or walks through long valleys with little visible fruit. If salvation rests on the performance of the believer, then salvation is no longer a gift — it is a wage. But Scripture removes all doubt:

> **“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.”**  
— *Ephesians 2:8–9*

If salvation is a gift, it cannot be maintained by effort. If righteousness is imputed, it cannot be un-imputed by inconsistency. If justification is finished, it cannot be undone by failure. Christ did not purchase a probation. He purchased **a people**.

It is not the perfection of the believer that holds salvation in place — it is the perfection of Christ.

> **“He is able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him.”**  
— *Hebrews 7:25*

To the uttermost. Not until they fail, not until they disappoint, not until they fall.  
**To the uttermost**.

Growth in the Christian life is real — but it is slow. Painfully slow. Intentionally slow. Because if God perfected us instantly, **we would become arrogant and cruel**, boasting in our achievement rather than broken in gratitude.

Paul himself confesses this holy slowness:

> **“Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on…”**  
— *Philippians 3:12*

If the apostle who saw heaven was not perfected, what madness makes men demand it of each other?

The legalist says:  
*“If you were truly saved, you wouldn’t struggle.”*  

But Scripture says the opposite:

> **“The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh… so that you do not do the things that you wish.”**  
— *Galatians 5:17*

Struggle is not proof of death — it is proof of life.  
Dead things do not fight.  
Only what is alive wrestles.

So is the unloving Christian still a Christian?  
Yes — because identity is determined by **birth**, not by behavior.

Jesus said:

> **“You must be born again.”**  
— *John 3:7*

Birth is irreversible.  
A child may grow slow, stumble, and fall, but he does not unborn himself.  
He does not rotate in and out of sonship depending on performance.

We are God’s children because we were **born**, not because we behave.

And Scripture seals the answer:

> **“He who began a good work in you will complete it.”**  
— *Philippians 1:6*

Not might complete it.  
Not hopes to complete it.  
**Will** complete it.

Christ is not a halfway Savior.  
He is the Author and Finisher of our faith (Hebrews 12:2).

Fruit is not the qualification for salvation — fruit is the slow unfolding of the life that Christ Himself planted. He bears the fruit, and He bears it **in His timing**.

> **“From Me is your fruit found.”**  
— *Hosea 14:8*

So what about the one who repeatedly fails, the one who hates his sin but falls again, the one who weeps at night believing he’s unworthy?

Scripture gives him the words he cannot say:

> **“Where sin abounded, grace abounded much more.”**  
— *Romans 5:20*

Grace does not excuse failure.  
Grace meets failure with mercy and power.  
Grace does not shrug at sin.  
Grace **overcomes sin by love**.

And what is the call of the church toward the weakest among us?

Not judge — restore.  
Not condemn — carry.  
Not suspect — surround.

> **“Bear one another’s burdens.”**  
— *Galatians 6:2*

Christ is not ashamed of His weak children — He is patient with them.  
He is not weary of shaping them — He delights in them.  
He does not despise small beginnings — He authored them.

The real danger is not a believer who is unloving.  
The real danger is a believer who becomes **afraid to believe he is loved**.

Because:

> **“Perfect love casts out fear.”**  
— *1 John 4:18*

The Christian who struggles is still a Christian — precisely because **he is Christ’s workmanship**, not his own (Ephesians 2:10). Christ will not lose one whom the Father has given Him (John 6:39). Not one.

We grow because **He grows us**, not because we are strong.
We endure because **He holds us**, not because we cling tightly.
We bear fruit because **He is the Vine**, and we are simply branches.

The Gospel is not God plus effort.  
The Gospel is **Christ in me**, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27).

  <summary><strong>Q6 — Who actually bears the fruit in the Christian life?</strong></summary>

### **Q: Who bears the fruit in the Christian life, and how does it happen? What is our role?**

The answer is as staggering as it is simple: **Christ Himself bears the fruit.** We do not produce it. We do not manufacture it. We do not strain to generate it. We do not supply the power for it. Fruit is not the result of human discipline — fruit is the result of **divine indwelling**.

Jesus did not say, “Work hard to bear fruit.”  
He did not say, “Climb, strain, strive, and prove yourselves.”  
He said:

> **“I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.”**  
— *John 15:5*

Nothing.  
Not *little*.  
Not *less*.  
**Nothing.**

A branch does not produce fruit by effort — it produces fruit by **connection**. The branch contributes nothing except surrender. The vine supplies everything: life, strength, sap, sweetness, and the very existence of the fruit itself.

The Christian life is not a life we live **for** Christ — it is a life Christ lives **through** us.

Paul defines the miracle in one sentence that cuts through centuries of religion:

> **“It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.”**  
— *Galatians 2:20*

Christianity is not self-improvement.  
Christianity is **self-replacement**.  
Not “help from Christ,” but **Christ instead of me**.

The legalist asks, “What must I do to produce fruit?”  
The Gospel answers, **“You cannot.”**

The legalist asks, “How do I perform the Christian life?”  
The Gospel answers, **“You don’t — Christ does.”**

Fruit is not something we show God; fruit is something God shows the world through us.

Jesus said:

> **“As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you.”**  
— *John 15:4*

The branch without the vine does not try harder — it dies.  
Effort without Christ is spiritual death.  
Dependence on Christ is spiritual life.

So what, then, is our role?

**Abide.** Rest. Remain. Stay close. Stay open. Stay surrendered. Stay trusting.  
Let the life of Another fill you.

> **“Abide in Me.”**  
— *John 15:4*

Abiding does not mean performing.  
Abiding does not mean perfection.  
Abiding does not mean pretending.

Abiding means **refusing to leave the place where grace found you**.

It means believing when the flesh screams,
trusting when the heart trembles,
resting when the enemy accuses,
returning when you fall,
receiving instead of achieving.

Religion says:  
**“Do more. Try harder. Prove yourself.”**

Christ says:  
**“Come to Me… and I will give you rest.”**  
— *Matthew 11:28*

Paul reveals God’s astonishing method:

> **“For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.”**  
— *Philippians 2:13*

He gives the willing.  
He gives the doing.  
He gives the fruit.  
He gets the glory.

The fruit of the Spirit is not the fruit of the Christian.

> **“The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace…”**  
— *Galatians 5:22*

The Spirit bears the fruit **in us**, **through us**, **for us**, **despite us**, and **to the glory of Christ**.

So when a believer is overflowing with love,
when forgiveness flows freely,
when peace reigns where war once burned,
when joy erupts in impossible places,
when humility replaces pride,
when generosity triumphs over greed,
when purity conquers addiction —

**It is not the work of the Christian — it is the life of Christ.**

We cannot boast.  
We cannot claim credit.  
We cannot measure ourselves or others by the speed of growth.  
We can only marvel that the Vine lives in the branch and produces the very thing He commands.

He is the Gardener.  
He is the Vine.  
He is the Life.  
He is the Fruit.  
He is the Glory.

And we?  
We are the beloved branches, held in His hands, carried by His grace.

  <summary><strong>Q7 — What do Christians do to feel right with God?</strong></summary>

### **Q: What do Christians do to feel right with God? How do we live from rest instead of striving or guilt?**

The shocking answer of the Gospel is this: **We do nothing** to feel right with God. Nothing to climb. Nothing to earn. Nothing to prove. Nothing to maintain. Nothing to strengthen by religious performance or weaken by personal failure. The believer’s standing with God does not rise and fall with behavior. It stands forever and immovably on the finished work of Christ.

God is not waiting to feel good about us until we perform.  
God is not cautiously optimistic, evaluating progress before acceptance.  
God is not holding us at arm’s length until we measure up.

He has already declared the verdict:

> **“Having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”**  
— *Romans 5:1*

We *have* peace — not *are trying to get peace*.  
Peace is not a goal. **Peace is a gift.**  
Justification is not a process. **Justification is a finished event.**

The Christian is right with God because Christ is right with God — and we are in Him.

Salvation is not God plus man.  
Salvation is **God alone**.  
Our only response is **to believe what He has done**.

Jesus does not hand us a ladder.  
He hands us a **seat**.

> **“And raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.”**  
— *Ephesians 2:6*

Religion says: *stand up and climb until you reach God.*  
The Gospel says: **sit down — He already reached you.**

So how do we live the Christian life?  
How do we “feel right” when we fail, when we stumble, when we fall short?

We return to the only place strength is ever found:

**We rest. We abide. We believe.**

We look not at ourselves, but at Christ.  
We trust not our performance, but His perfection.  
We listen not to accusation, but to the Advocate.

> **“There is therefore now no condemnation…”**  
— *Romans 8:1*

Not less condemnation.  
**No condemnation.**

If we feel condemned, we are believing a lie — not living the truth.

The believer is commanded to rest because **rest is the only posture where Christ can work**. As long as we strive, we block grace. As long as we try to prove ourselves, we refuse to receive what has already been given.

Paul exposes the danger:

> **“You have become estranged from Christ… you have fallen from grace.”**  
— *Galatians 5:4*

Not fallen into sin — fallen into **self-effort**.  
The worst fall is not moral failure, but returning to law.

Christians “feel right” with God when they stop trying to be their own savior and allow Jesus to be the Savior He already is.

We do not climb toward acceptance.  
**We begin at acceptance.**

We do not obey in order to be loved.  
**We obey because we are loved.**

We do not strive to be fruitful.  
**We abide and fruit comes.**

We do not work for identity.  
**We work from identity.**

We do not live for victory.  
**We live from victory.**

Rest is not inactivity — rest is **trust**.  
Rest is not laziness — rest is **dependency**.  
Rest is not indifference — rest is **confidence in Christ instead of self**.

> **“This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent.”**  
— *John 6:29*

The greatest work of the Christian life is to **believe** what Christ has already done.

When we fall, we do not panic.  
We do not fear losing God.  
We do not try to earn our way back.

We lift our eyes, confess our weakness, and fall into grace.

We say with David:

> **“Restore to me the joy of Your salvation.”**  
— *Psalm 51:12*

Not *restore salvation* — it was never lost.  
Restore *joy* — because joy rests in grace.

And with Paul:

> **“When I am weak, then I am strong.”**  
— *2 Corinthians 12:10*

The place of weakness is the place of power, because weakness collapses into Christ.

So how do we rest in Him?

We abandon confidence in the flesh.  
We stop trying to fix ourselves.  
We look to the cross, again and again.  
We let His voice drown out every other.  
We preach the Gospel to ourselves daily.  
We say, **“It is finished,”** because He did.

Rest is not a feeling.  
Rest is a decision.

A decision to trust.  
A decision to stop striving.  
A decision to sit where Christ has seated us.  
A decision to let Him carry what we cannot.

We do not rest because we are strong — **we rest because Christ is strong for us.**

  <summary><strong>Q8 — How do we practically rest in Christ day to day?</strong></summary>

### **Q: How do we practically rest in Him? What does daily life look like in this freedom and trust?**

Resting in Christ is not mystical, complicated, or abstract. It is not a technique or a method or a spiritual posture achieved through discipline. It is the simplest act in the world — and the hardest for proud flesh to accept:

**Rest means believing that Christ is enough.**
Every hour.  
Every moment.  
Every failure.  
Every fear.  
Every weakness.

Rest means refusing to return to the old covenant mindset that says, “Do more, try harder, fix yourself, prove yourself, make God proud.” The cross declares the opposite: **God is already satisfied**, already reconciled, already delighted, already at peace with those who have placed their trust in the Son.

> **“This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”**  
— *Matthew 3:17*

And if we are in the Beloved, then the Father is well pleased with us — right now — not one day when we finally get it together.

Daily rest means waking up each morning and choosing **faith instead of fear**, **trust instead of striving**, **abiding instead of performing**, **receiving instead of achieving**.

It means saying:
> **“Father, I am Yours. You live in me. You will bear Your fruit. You will finish Your work. I surrender. I trust You.”**

It means refusing to measure our spiritual health by our emotions, performance, or circumstances — all of which crumble and change — and measuring everything by the unshakeable truth of the Word:

> **“We walk by faith, not by sight.”**  
— *2 Corinthians 5:7*

It means letting Christ be Himself in us. Letting Him love through us. Letting Him forgive through us. Letting Him speak through us. Letting Him strengthen us when we are weak instead of pretending to be strong.

It means ceasing from trying to produce fruit and instead remaining available to receive it. Jesus did not say, “Go and bear fruit.” He said:

> **“Abide in Me… and you will bear much fruit.”**  
— *John 15:5*

Fruit is not our job. **Abiding is.**  
Transformation is not our burden. **Rest is.**

So what does resting look like when temptation comes?  
It looks like stopping — not striving.  
It looks like sitting — not fighting in the flesh.  
It looks like saying: **“Lord, I cannot — but You can.”**  
It looks like waiting until the storm passes instead of promising we’ll do better.  
It looks like choosing dependence instead of self-confidence.

What does resting look like when we fail?  
It looks like running to God instead of running from Him.  
It looks like collapsing into mercy instead of crawling through shame.  
It looks like saying:  
**“Thank You for the blood. Thank You that I am forgiven. Thank You that You do not remember this. Thank You that You will finish Your work in me.”**

Rest means refusing to let sin define us.  
Rest means refusing to let fear instruct us.  
Rest means refusing to let condemnation narrate our identity.  
Rest means refusing to act like employees when we are sons.

> **“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”**  
— *Galatians 3:26*

We rest by trusting the truth more than our feelings.  
We rest by believing God’s Word over our performance.  
We rest by returning again and again to the simplicity of Christ.

The world says: *Do. Perform. Impress. Climb.*  
Religion says: *Earn. Prove. Maintain. Fear.*  
Christ says:

> **“Come to Me… and I will give you rest.”**  
— *Matthew 11:28*

Rest is not laziness.  
Rest is worship.  
Rest is surrender.  
Rest is confidence in the finished work of Another.  
Rest is the posture of a child in a Father’s arms.

When storms come — **rest.**  
When failure stings — **rest.**  
When doubt whispers — **rest.**  
When the flesh rises — **rest.**  
When fear lies — **rest.**  
When Satan accuses — **rest.**

Rest is the highest form of faith.  
Rest is the loudest declaration of trust.  
Rest is the clearest evidence of the New Covenant.  
Rest is the soil in which Christ grows His fruit.

We do not rest because life is easy.  
We rest because **He finished the work**.

> **“It is finished.”**  
— *John 19:30*

The cross is our foundation.  
The resurrection is our guarantee.  
Pentecost is our power.  
Abiding is our calling.  
Love is our life.  
Christ is our rest.

And He will not fail.

> **“Faithful is He who calls you, who also will do it.”**  
— *1 Thessalonians 5:24*

Amen.  
Let it be so.
