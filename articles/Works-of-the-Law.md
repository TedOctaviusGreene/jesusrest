# O Foolish Galatians: What Did Paul Mean by “Works of the Law”?

**“O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth…?”**  
Paul’s words in Galatians 3 still echo down through every century, exposing the same error wherever it resurfaces.

Herbert W. Armstrong, and the churches that follow his doctrine, insist that the Apostle’s phrase *“works of the law”* in Galatians 3 means only the sacrificial system. By narrowing Paul’s words in this way, they seek to preserve the Ten Commandments and holy days as binding today, while discarding sacrifices. But is that what Paul actually meant?

## The Phrase *Ergōn Nomou* — “Works of the Law”

In Galatians 3:2, 3:5, and 3:10 Paul uses the Greek phrase *ergōn nomou* — literally, “works of law.”  
The Armstrong position claims this refers merely to the rituals and sacrifices. But Paul himself shows it means much more.

In Galatians 3:10 he quotes directly from **Deuteronomy 27:26**:

> *“Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things written in the book of the law, to do them.”*

The “book of the law” included **all covenant commands**: moral, civil, and ceremonial. It was not limited to sacrifices. Paul’s citation makes plain that if you place yourself under the law, you are bound to keep **all of it** — and cursed if you fail.

## Works of Law vs. Faith

Notice Paul’s contrast:  
- *“The law is not of faith, but the man who does them shall live by them.”* (Galatians 3:12)  
- *“The just shall live by faith.”* (Galatians 3:11, quoting Habakkuk 2:4)

The issue is not sacrifices versus commandments. The issue is **law-keeping versus faith in Christ.**  
The principle of justification by “works of law” is opposed to justification by faith. This is why Paul can say in Galatians 2:16:

> *“A man is not justified by works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ.”*

## Why Armstrong’s Interpretation Fails

If “works of the law” referred only to sacrifices, Paul’s argument collapses:  
- Gentile believers in Galatia had never practiced sacrifices — why then would he rebuke them for trusting in sacrifices?  
- His warning would not explain why festivals, Sabbaths, and holy days are included in his list of **shadows** in Colossians 2:16–17.  
- Nor would it explain why Paul connects the curse of the law to **all things written** in it (Gal. 3:10).

The truth is plain: Paul is not rebuking Gentiles for clinging to sacrifices. He is rebuking them for trying to be **perfected by law** after beginning with **faith in Christ.**

## Paul’s Rebuke Still Stands

Paul asks in Galatians 3:3:

> *“Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?”*

That question strikes at the heart of COG theology. They begin with faith in Christ, but then insist on perfection through fleshly observance of the old covenant — Sabbaths, holy days, and food laws. Paul’s rebuke leaves no room for this mixture. To seek justification by works of law is to abandon the grace of Christ.

## The True Gospel in Galatians 3

- **Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law** by becoming a curse for us (Gal. 3:13).  
- **The promise is received by faith, not by law** (Gal. 3:22).  
- **The law was a tutor leading to Christ** — but now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor (Gal. 3:24–25).

The message is unshakable:  
**The “works of the law” are not limited to sacrifices. They encompass the entire covenant system. Paul sweeps it all aside as a means of justification, because only faith in Christ makes us righteous.**

> *O foolish Galatians!*  
Paul’s cry is just as relevant today. The error he exposed then resurfaces now in the doctrines of Armstrongism. But the Word of God stands: **the righteous shall live by faith.**
