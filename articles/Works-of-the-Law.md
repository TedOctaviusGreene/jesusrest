# O Foolish Galatians: What Did Paul Mean by “Works of the Law”?

**“O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth…?”**  
Paul’s words in Galatians 3 still echo down through every century, exposing the same error wherever it resurfaces.

Herbert W. Armstrong, and the churches that follow his doctrine on this point, insist that the Apostle’s phrase *“works of the law”* in Galatians 3 means only the sacrificial system. By narrowing Paul’s words in this way, they seek to preserve the Ten Commandments and holy days as binding today, while discarding sacrifices. But is that what Paul actually meant?

## The Phrase *Ergōn Nomou* — “Works of the Law”

In Galatians 3:2, 3:5, and 3:10 Paul uses the Greek phrase *ergōn nomou* — literally, “works of law.”  
The Armstrong position claims this refers merely to the rituals and sacrifices. But Paul himself shows it means much more.

In Galatians 3:10 he quotes directly from **Deuteronomy 27:26**:

> *“Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things written in the book of the law, to do them.”*

The “book of the law” included **all covenant commands**: moral, civil, and ceremonial. It was not limited to sacrifices. Paul’s citation makes plain that if you place yourself under the law, you are bound to keep **all of it** — and cursed if you fail.

## Works of Law vs. Faith

Notice Paul’s contrast:  
- *“The law is not of faith, but the man who does them shall live by them.”* (Galatians 3:12)  
- *“The just shall live by faith.”* (Galatians 3:11, quoting Habakkuk 2:4)

The issue is not sacrifices versus commandments. The issue is **law-keeping versus faith in Christ.**  
The principle of justification by “works of law” is opposed to justification by faith. This is why Paul can say in Galatians 2:16:

> *“A man is not justified by works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ.”*

## Why Armstrong’s Interpretation Fails

If “works of the law” referred only to sacrifices, Paul’s argument collapses:  
- Gentile believers in Galatia had never practiced sacrifices — why then would he rebuke them for trusting in sacrifices?  
- His warning would not explain why festivals, Sabbaths, and holy days are included in his list of **shadows** in Colossians 2:16–17.  
- Nor would it explain why Paul connects the curse of the law to **all things written** in it (Gal. 3:10).

The truth is plain: Paul is not rebuking Gentiles for clinging to sacrifices. He is rebuking them for trying to be **perfected by law** after beginning with **faith in Christ.**

## Paul’s Rebuke Still Stands

Paul asks in Galatians 3:3:

> *“Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?”*

That question strikes at the heart of COG theology. They begin with faith in Christ, but then insist on perfection through fleshly observance of the old covenant — Sabbaths, holy days, and food laws. Paul’s rebuke leaves no room for this mixture. To seek justification by works of law is to abandon the grace of Christ.

## The True Gospel in Galatians 3

- **Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law** by becoming a curse for us (Gal. 3:13).  
- **The promise is received by faith, not by law** (Gal. 3:22).  
- **The law was a tutor leading to Christ** — but now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor (Gal. 3:24–25).

- ## What Were the “Works of the Law”?

When Paul wrote about *“works of the law”* in Galatians 3, he was not limiting the phrase to sacrifices alone. He had in view the whole system of covenantal obligations that Israel received at Mount Sinai. These were not moral absolutes binding on all mankind, but commands that belonged specifically to the covenant God made with Israel.

The law contained regulations about clean and unclean foods, tithing, circumcision, priestly washings, sacrifices, temple rituals, grain and drink offerings, restrictions on trimming the beard, commands about wearing mixed fabrics, tassels on garments, rules about touching the dead, and purification after childbirth. These were covenant obligations, not universal moral standards. They were binding only because God had made a covenant with Israel and placed them under its terms.

Paul makes this plain by quoting **Deuteronomy 27:26** in Galatians 3:10: *“Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.”* Notice carefully: not some things, not only sacrifices, but *all things written in the book of the law.* This included every regulation God gave to Israel at Sinai. To be under the law was to be bound to every part of it — and cursed for failing to keep it.

But these obligations were never given to the nations outside Israel. Moses himself said in **Deuteronomy 5:2–3**: *“The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. The LORD did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, those who are here today, all of us who are alive.”* The covenant was made with Israel, not with Abraham’s forefathers, and not with the Gentiles. This means that when the covenant ended, its regulations did not pass on to the whole world. They were fulfilled and finished in Christ.

This is why the apostles, when faced with the question of whether Gentile believers needed to be circumcised and keep the law of Moses, came together in Acts 15. The decision was clear: *“We should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God”* (Acts 15:19). They did not lay the covenant code on the nations, but only called them to turn from idols and immorality. The gospel they preached was not a new list of rituals, but the good news of Jesus Christ crucified and risen.

## The Good News of Jesus Christ Crucified and Risen

The old covenant system, with all its regulations, pointed forward to the reality of Christ. Once He came, the shadows had served their purpose. The apostles never laid those old commands on Gentiles, because the message of salvation was not a new list of rules but the announcement of what God had done in Christ.

### Christ Redeemed Us from the Curse
Paul writes in **Galatians 3:13–14**:  
*“Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree’), that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.”*

This is the heart of the gospel. We were under a curse because no one can continue in all things written in the law (Galatians 3:10). Jesus bore that curse on the cross, so that Jew and Gentile alike might receive the Spirit by faith.

### A Righteousness Apart from the Law
Paul declares in **Romans 3:21–22**:  
*“But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe.”*

Notice: righteousness is revealed *apart from the law*. The very Scriptures that once testified of the law now bear witness to the greater reality — righteousness through faith in Christ.

### Not a Covenant of Shadows but of Life
In **2 Corinthians 3:6** Paul says, *“[God] has made us sufficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.”* The old covenant, with its written code and outward works, brought condemnation. But the new covenant brings life through the Spirit, because it rests not on our works but on Christ’s finished work.

### The Gospel We Proclaim
This is why the apostles did not go out to the nations preaching Sabbaths, holy days, and washings. They preached Christ crucified and risen. Paul summarized his message this way:  

*“For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.”* (**1 Corinthians 15:3–4**)  

That was the gospel that turned the world upside down. It was not a new law code but the proclamation of a crucified and risen Savior.

> The good news is this: **Jesus fulfilled the covenant and bore its curse, so that we could be justified by faith and receive the Spirit.** That is why the New Testament proclaims Christ, not covenant regulations. The old law pointed forward to Him, but now He has come — and in Him we have life, righteousness, and freedom.


Paul explains in **Galatians 3:24–25**: *“Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.”* The law pointed Israel forward to Christ, showing their need for a Savior. But once the Savior came, the tutor’s role was finished. To insist on continuing the old covenant regulations is to miss the reality to which they pointed.

---

> The “works of the law” included all these covenant obligations, from food laws to sacrifices to circumcision and beyond. And yes, at the very heart of those shadows were the **Sabbath day and the annual holy days**. They were never moral requirements for the whole world, but covenant signs given to Israel. Now that the covenant has ended, they remain as shadows pointing to Christ, but the reality — the substance — is found in Him alone.


The message is unshakable:  
**The “works of the law” are not limited to sacrifices. They encompass the entire covenant system. Paul sweeps it all aside as a means of justification, because only faith in Christ justifies and makes us righteous.**

---

> *O foolish Galatians!*  
Paul’s cry is just as relevant today. The error he exposed resurfaces today as many confuse "works of the law" with "works of faith." But the Word of God stands: **the righteous shall live by faith.**
