### Introduction

Every year millions of people type into Google:

- Should Christians celebrate Christmas?
- Is Christmas pagan?
- Is the Christmas tree in Jeremiah 10?
- Are we sinning by keeping Christmas?
- Is it wrong to celebrate Christmas?

And every year, Christians answer emotionally from tradition, reaction, guilt, fear, or denominational pressure—but rarely from Scripture **using Scripture’s own rules for truth**, letting the Bible interpret itself, line upon line, precept upon precept.

At JesusRest.com, our pursuit is simple:

## What does God actually say in His Word when we remove assumptions, traditions, fear, and pride?

We search for pure, unadulterated biblical truth that crucifies boasting, exalts Christ alone, humbles the proud, and sets captives free.

So the real question isn’t:

> Is Christmas pagan?

The real question is:

> What is the truth of the Gospel, and what does Jesus Christ actually require of believers under the New Covenant?

# I. The Most Important Truth: We Are Not Under the Law

Paul states clearly:

> **“You are not under the law, but under grace.”** — Romans 6:14

> **“The law was our tutor, to bring us to Christ, but after faith has come, we are no longer under the tutor.”** — Galatians 3:24-25

> **“(He) abolished in His flesh the law of commandments contained in ordinances.”** — Ephesians 2:15

> **“The ministry engraved on stones… has been done away.”** — 2 Corinthians 3:7-11

The first covenant—with its regulations of days, rituals, shadows, and ceremonial restrictions—has **ended**.  
It **vanished** (Hebrews 8:13).  
Christ **fulfilled it completely** (Matthew 5:17) and replaced it with something **better**, built on **better promises** (Hebrews 8:6).

### So the standard for the New Covenant is not:

- Do this
- Don’t do that
- Observe this day
- Reject that day
- Handle not, touch not, taste not (Colossians 2:21-22)

### The standard now is only:

> **Love — the fulfillment of all law**  
> (Romans 13:10)

# II. Is Keeping Christmas a Sin?

Paul addresses this exact question about religious days:

> **“One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind.”** — Romans 14:5

And he concludes:

> **“Therefore let no one judge you regarding a festival, or a new moon, or Sabbaths. These were shadows… but the substance is Christ.”** — Colossians 2:16-17

If the shadow Sabbaths are not mandatory, how much more a holiday never commanded at all?

### Paul’s central principle:

> **“All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful.”** — 1 Corinthians 10:23

Christmas is therefore not about legality, but love.

# III. What About the Christmas Tree? Is Jeremiah 10 About Christmas?

Millions ask every December:

> Is the Christmas tree pagan? Isn’t it forbidden in Jeremiah 10?

Here is what Jeremiah actually says:

> **“They cut a tree… shape it with a chisel… they adorn it with silver and gold… they bow down to it and worship it.”** — Jeremiah 10:3-5 (paraphrased)

That passage describes:

- A carved idol
- Formed into a false god
- Bowed before
- Worshipped
- Trusted for power and protection

Nobody today worships a Douglas Fir, lays prostrate before a plastic pre-lit tree, or prays to an ornament.

### Conclusion:

If it’s not worship, it’s not idolatry.

Idolatry is not possessing something pagans once used.  
Idolatry is trusting anything instead of Christ.

> **“To the pure, all things are pure.”** — Titus 1:15

# IV. What About Verses Saying Not to Worship Like the Nations?

People often quote:

> **“Do not worship the Lord your God in their ways.”** — Deuteronomy 12:30-32

But that was part of the **first covenant**, which Scripture declares:

> **“He takes away the first to establish the second.”** — Hebrews 10:9

Through Christ:

- The dividing wall is destroyed (Ephesians 2:14-15)
- The handwriting of requirements is removed (Colossians 2:14)
- We die to the law (Romans 7:4-6)
- We walk by the Spirit, not written rules (Galatians 5:18)

### The New Covenant is not about avoiding objects
It is about:

- Love
- Conscience
- Freedom
- Faith
- Christ alone

### So is it sinful to put a tree in your house and exchange gifts?

No.

### Could someone keep Christmas sinfully?

Yes—if they:

- Worship the tree
- Believe the holiday earns salvation
- Boast in works
- Condemn others who don’t observe it

Sin is always unloving. Decorating a tree is not unloving.

# V. What Did Paul Do With Cultural Days?

Paul used cultural days strategically:

> **“I have become all things to all, that I might save some.”** — 1 Corinthians 9:22

Paul preached Christ **in synagogues on Sabbaths and festival days**, not because he was bound to them, but because people were present and listening.

Likewise, Christmas is the one time of year:

- Hearts are soft
- People ask spiritual questions
- The world is already singing about Jesus

Why not proclaim Him?

# VI. The Gospel That Makes Christmas Beautiful

The Gospel is not:

- Do more
- Try harder
- Stop celebrating
- Keep regulations
- Earn favor

The Gospel is:

> **A free gift** (Romans 6:23)  
> **Not of works** (Ephesians 2:8-9)  
> **Christ in you** (Colossians 1:27)  
> **Finished** (John 19:30)

We don’t keep Christmas to earn God’s love.  
We celebrate because:

- God already loves us
- Christ already finished the work
- Salvation is His gift, not our performance

Christmas becomes:

- A celebration of grace
- A testimony of joy
- A moment to share Christ with the world

# Final Answer

### Should Christians celebrate Christmas?

### Yes — if they do so in love, freedom, and the joy of Christ.  
### No — if they do so from fear, condemnation, or superstition.

Christmas is not commanded.  
Christmas is not forbidden.  
Christmas is free.

**Love fulfills the whole law.**  
**Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.**  
**Christ is all.**

# Prayer

Lord, teach us to walk in love.  
Free us from fear.  
Free us from pride.  
Free us from the bondage of do and don’t.  
Let everything we do point to Christ, not to ourselves.  
Amen.
