# Feast of Tabernacles 2025 and the Sabbath
## Understanding the New Covenant Sabbath and Holy Days-How they Still Existed but Without the Prohibtition to Work

As the Feast of Tabernacles 2025 approaches, many wonder what the Sabbath and holy days mean under the New Covenant. Explore a surprising freedom hidden in Scripture.

The God of Scripture is both unimaginably holy and deeply loving. He longs to dwell among His people, yet His blazing holiness cannot tolerate sin (Ex 19:16-21). To protect sinful humans from being consumed by His glory, the Lord often revealed Himself through *“the angel of the LORD,”* a messenger who veiled His presence (Ex 3:2; Judg 6:12–23). The law and sacrificial system were gracious, provisional measures that allowed a holy God to live among a sinful nation. They taught Israel that sin separates us from God and that blood must be shed to cover guilt (Lev 17:11). The Sinai covenant therefore functioned as a tutor, revealing both God’s holiness and our need for a mediator—and foreshadowing the remedy that would come through the Messiah.

The covenant made at Sinai was not a loose collection of moral principles but a national constitution binding Israel to God. Moses read *“all the words of the Lord and all the judgments”* to the people, who responded, *“All that the Lord has said we will do”* (Ex 24:3). He then took the book of the covenant, sprinkled it with blood, and said:

> *“This is the blood of the covenant which the Lord has made with you according to all these words.”*  
> — Exodus 24:7-8  

The covenant included the Ten Commandments written on stone as well as statutes and ordinances governing civil and ceremonial life. James later summarised its integrated nature:  

> *“Whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all.”*  
> — James 2:10  

Under that covenant the commands and statutes were inseparable: violating any part breached the whole. For example, an Israelite who gathered sticks on the Sabbath was stoned to death (Num 15:32-36), and one who secretly worshipped other gods was likewise executed (Deut 17:2-5). The covenant was a single package—its moral commands and its ritual prohibitions carried the same weight. You cannot arbitrarily lift one practice from this covenant while discarding others without breaking the agreement itself.

The covenant’s enforcement relied on a Levitical priesthood and a temple system. If an Israelite sinned, he brought sacrifices to the tabernacle where priests mediated between him and God. The high priest entered the Most Holy Place once a year on the Day of Atonement, separated from the people by a heavy veil. This entire system—the tablets of stone, the priesthood and the sacrificial rituals—stood or fell together. To “abolish” one part while retaining another was impossible.

Because this covenant was indivisible, its signs were entrusted to a specific people rather than to all humanity. Exodus 31 underscores that the weekly Sabbath was given as a sign between the Lord and *“the children of Israel”* throughout their generations (Exod 31:16–17). It reminded Israel that the Lord had sanctified them and delivered them from Egyptian bondage (Deut 5:15).  

Scripture never commands Gentile nations to rest on Israel’s Sabbath; instead, Isaiah foresees foreigners willingly joining themselves to the Lord and choosing to keep His Sabbath because they love His name (Isa 56:6–7). Under the old covenant, however, violating this sign was as serious as idolatry: gathering sticks on the Sabbath or secretly serving other gods incurred the death penalty (Num 15:32–36; Deut 17:2–5). You cannot detach one statute from that covenant and carry it into the new covenant without tearing the covenant itself.

## Why Did God End the Covenant?

Because it was preparatory. The law functioned as a guardian to lead Israel to Christ (Gal 3:24). Its priesthood, sacrifices and holy-day calendar were foreshadows pointing toward a greater reality. To grasp what that reality is, the letter to the Hebrews invites us to ponder *rest.*

In Hebrews 3–4 the author develops this theme with carefully chosen words. The primary noun **katapausis** means “rest” — not merely ceasing, but refreshment, satisfaction, a settled peace. The Septuagint uses the word this way in Exodus 33:14: *“My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest [katapauseō].”* It is the same word used when God speaks of His own dwelling satisfaction: *“What is the place of My rest [katapauseōs]?”* (Acts 7:49).  

In Hebrews it refers to God’s rest, as well as the rest Joshua never gave Israel in Canaan (Heb 4:4, 8–10). The related verb **katapauō** means “to cause to rest” (Heb 4:8). A second noun, **sabbatismos**, appears only in Hebrews 4:9: *“There remains therefore a rest for the people of God.”* Together these words show that the Sabbath, the Promised Land, and even the seventh day of creation were all anticipating something richer.

Israel first learned rest at Sinai. God commanded:  

> *“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day [shabbat, literally seventh] is the Sabbath of the LORD your God. In it you shall do no work.”*  
> — Exodus 20:8–10  

Notice the distinction: the word Sabbath itself simply means *seventh*; it is not the Hebrew word for *rest.* The Greek translation of Exodus 20 reflects the same, using *sabbaton* for Sabbath (seventh) and *katapausis* when God adds His own rest to it (cf. Heb 4:4). The day by itself was simply seventh in sequence. What gave it meaning was that God placed His own rest upon it.

This pattern is clear from creation:  

> *“And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested [katapausen in Greek] on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.”*  
> — Genesis 2:2 (LXX)  

God did not rest because He was tired, but because He was satisfied. After each day He declared His work *“good,”* and when He finished He delighted in it. The seventh day became holy not because of anything inherent in the number seven, but because God set it apart as the day He attached His rest to.  

Holiness in the old covenant was always something God conferred, not something inherent in the object or day itself. The tabernacle, the altar, the priesthood, even the vessels were *“made holy”* because God set them apart for a purpose. When that covenant ended, their holiness passed away with it. So it was with the Sabbath: God made the seventh day holy for Israel, but that holiness pointed forward to something greater.

Israel was reminded of this again in Deuteronomy:  

> *“And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out… therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.”*  
> — Deuteronomy 5:15  

Ceasing from labor was a declaration of freedom. They were no longer Pharaoh’s property. Anyone who never pauses is a slave to something, whether an ancient taskmaster or the modern idol of overwork. The Sabbath in Israel’s story was a celebration of liberation.

And yet Hebrews makes clear that these shadows did not bestow ultimate rest. Those who hardened their hearts *“could not enter [God’s] rest”* because of unbelief (Heb 3:18–19). The Sabbath law gave them a weekly pause, and Canaan gave them a homeland, but both were temporary signposts. The true **katapausis**—the rest of God Himself—was still waiting.

## Why Joshua Couldn’t Give Rest

But even after entering the land, Israel still lacked this true sabbatismos rest. Hebrews 4:8 explains:  

> *“If Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day.”*  

Centuries after the conquest of Canaan, Psalm 95 was still warning God’s people not to miss His rest.  

And what “day” was David speaking of? Hebrews quotes it repeatedly:  

> *“Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”*  
> — Hebrews 3:7; 3:15; 4:7  

The Spirit deliberately says **Today** — not *“the seventh day,”* not a calendar observance. The message is that the real day of entering God’s rest is the day you hear the gospel and believe in Christ.

The conclusion is unavoidable: the weekly Sabbath and the land were not the final rest. They were shadows pointing forward. The true **sabbatismos** is entered any day, whenever a heart turns in faith to Jesus.  

> *“There remains therefore a rest [sabbatismos] for the people of God.”*  
> — Hebrews 4:9  

This *“rest that remains”* is not the weekly Sabbath Israel already had, but something greater. Just as Jesus magnified the law—exposing that hatred is murder in seed form and lust is adultery in seed form—here the Sabbath itself is magnified. Its completion is found in Christ, who offers rest that is not bound to a calendar but is entered every day by faith.  

Thus the true **katapausis**—the rest of God Himself—is fully expressed in the **sabbatismos,** the *“rest that remains.”* It is the gospel rest, the present satisfaction and refreshment of ceasing from our own works and trusting in Christ’s finished work, while also looking forward to the millennial and eternal rest in His kingdom.

## Entering by Faith

Hebrews 4:10 continues:  

> *“For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.”*  

But how is that rest entered? The answer has already been given:  

> *“Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it. For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it. For we who have believed do enter that rest.”*  
> — Hebrews 4:1–3  

The rest is entered by faith in the gospel. Israel had Sabbath days and Canaan, but without faith they never had rest. Believers today cease from their own works when they trust Christ instead of themselves. On the cross He cried:  

> *“It is finished.”*  
> — John 19:30  

His finished work—not ours—is the foundation of the true rest.

---

## Present and Future

The gospel rest is both *“now”* and *“not yet.”* It is entered today by faith in Christ, but it also looks ahead to the millennial reign of Jesus and beyond that to the eternal rest at God’s throne:  

> *“Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool. What house will you build Me? Or what is the place of My rest?”*  
> — Acts 7:49  

This is why Hebrews 4 suddenly shifts to the penetrating power of Scripture. God’s word is *“living and powerful… sharper than any two-edged sword… a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”* It slices through our self-deception and exposes our motivations. The author continues:  

> *“There is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.”*  

In other words, we will never enter into this rest until we admit our spiritual nakedness. Like Adam and Eve, we sew fig leaves of legalism, dead works, good works or excuses to cover our shame. The law reveals that those coverings are threadbare.  

When we finally stand exposed before God—when His word shows us that our hearts are restless because we are trying to be our own saviors—then we can rest in the righteousness of Christ, our High Priest who sympathizes with our weakness and brings us into God’s presence.

## The New Covenant Instituted by Jesus

Jesus Himself announced that He was instituting something new. At the Last Supper He declared:  

> *“This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you.”*  
> — Luke 22:20 (cf. 1 Cor 11:25)  

With the new covenant came a new priesthood (Heb 7:11-14) and a new law written on hearts rather than stone (Heb 8:10). The author of Hebrews notes that in speaking of a new covenant God *“has made the first obsolete.”*  

Paul, reflecting on the tablets of stone, calls that ministry *“the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones”* and declares that its fading glory has been surpassed by the ministry of the Spirit (2 Cor 3:7-11). Notice that he refers specifically to the law written on stones—the Ten Commandments. The moral truths behind those commandments remain valid, but the ritual prohibition of working on the Sabbath was a shadow that has been fulfilled.  

Human goodness and law-keeping could never make anyone right with God because *“all have sinned and fall short”* (Rom 3:23). We need a better covenant that forgives sin and transforms hearts. Scripture teaches that a righteousness apart from the law has been revealed, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe (Rom 3:21-22). Through His death and resurrection, God *“made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him”* (2 Cor 5:21).  

When we trust Christ, His righteousness is credited to us and we receive the Holy Spirit, who writes God’s law on our hearts (Gal 3:14; Heb 10:15-16).

In other words, the paradox revealed under the old covenant—how a holy God could be among sinful people—is resolved in Jesus. He bore our iniquities and paid the penalty that the law demanded, and He imputes His righteousness to everyone who believes. Because He has cleansed us, God’s own Spirit can dwell within us without consuming us (John 14:17; 1 Cor 6:19). This is the heart of the new covenant: not merely external rules but an inner transformation by grace.

He writes that believers now serve in *“newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter”* (Rom 7:6). Christ’s death ended the old covenant in full and confirmed the new; at that moment *“the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom”* (Matt 27:51). God ripped open the barrier separating humanity from His presence, signaling the end of the old system.  

No longer did a priesthood stand between the believer and God; we have *“boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus”* (Heb 10:19). This access is possible because God imputes Christ’s righteousness to those who believe and indwells them by His Spirit (Heb 10:14-15).

With the inauguration of the new covenant the sign is no longer a holy day but a holy Person. Jesus took bread and wine and said:  

> *“This cup is the new covenant in My blood.”*  
> — Luke 22:20  

Paul explains that God seals believers with the Holy Spirit as a guarantee (2 Cor 1:22; Eph 1:13). Circumcision of the heart by the Spirit, not circumcision of the flesh, marks out the people of God (Rom 2:29). Our identity is no longer tethered to a day on the calendar but to the indwelling Spirit who unites us to Christ. Faith in Jesus, demonstrated in baptism and the Lord’s Supper, is the sign of belonging to the new covenant community.  

To insist on retaining the old sign—mandatory Sabbath-keeping—while embracing Christ is like wearing a wedding ring from a previous marriage after you have already married someone else. The ring might remind you of the past, but it no longer defines your covenant status.

## The Sabbath’s Place in the Old and New Covenants

Understanding this dramatic shift has profound implications for Sabbath observance. If the old covenant was a package deal—law, priesthood, sacrifices and all—then its conclusion means that its signs and rituals no longer bind God’s people. The covenant written on stone served its purpose until Christ fulfilled it. When He cried *“It is finished!”* (*tetelestai*), He proclaimed that God’s redemptive plan had been brought to completion (John 19:30).  

To continue enforcing the old covenant’s rituals is like insisting that a canceled contract remains in force after a new agreement has been signed. Armstrong and many in the Churches of God often cite Matthew 5:17-19 to argue that Jesus made the law more binding. They interpret *“fulfill”* (*plēroō*) as “fill up” or “reinforce” the commandments. Yet in Matthew’s Gospel the verb *plēroō* consistently means *“bring to fulfillment”* or *“complete”* (Matt 1:22; 2:15).  

Jesus did not come to strengthen the old covenant but to accomplish the very things to which it pointed (Luke 24:44). When He said *“till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled,”* the phrase *“till all is fulfilled”* (Greek: *heōs an panta genētai*) signals the law’s goal. On the cross He declared, *“It is finished,”* indicating that the prophetic and sacrificial requirements were satisfied.  

While the moral call to love God and neighbor continues (Matt 22:37-40), the ritual code—including the prohibition against working on the Sabbath—has been set aside (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14).

## Armstrong’s Claim and the Sabbath’s Place

Herbert W. Armstrong was correct in noting that the Sabbath predates Sinai. Genesis 2 records that God ceased from His creative work, blessed the seventh day and sanctified it. Jesus affirmed that *“the Sabbath was made for man”* (Mark 2:27)—a gift for humanity rather than a burden— and on this point we agree. Armstrong’s mistake was to conclude that because the Sabbath predates Sinai it must remain a binding legal requirement after the cross. To defend this, he proposed a separate Sabbath covenant based on Exodus 31:12-17. In his reading, God made an everlasting covenant about the Sabbath after the Sinai covenant was sealed, ensuring that Sabbath observance continues under the new covenant.

Many in the Churches of God continue to emphasize these claims. They insist that because the Fourth Commandment predates Sinai it cannot pass away. Sunday worship is viewed as a pagan innovation, and identity as God’s people is tied to seventh-day observance. The Sabbath, they believe, stands apart from the rest of the law. We honor the sincerity and zeal behind this commitment even as we invite you to reconsider how the Sabbath fits within God’s unfolding covenants.

Scripture, however, places the Sabbath squarely within the covenant that has been fulfilled. Moses told Israel, *“He declared to you His covenant … the Ten Commandments, and He wrote them on two tablets of stone”* (Deut 4:13). The Decalogue itself was the covenant. It contained the Fourth Commandment precisely because Israel needed a weekly sign to remind them of their deliverance from Egypt (Deut 5:15). When Israel later broke the covenant, God compared their violation of the Sabbath to adultery and idolatry (Ezek 20:12-13)—a warning that underscored the covenantal nature of the day. Exodus 31 explicitly calls the Sabbath a sign between God and *“the children of Israel”* (Exod 31:16-17). This sign marked out Israel’s relationship with God during that specific covenant; it was never given to the nations.  

The Hebrew word **ʿolam** (“everlasting”) can mean “age-long”; other rituals described as *“perpetual,”* such as circumcision and the Levitical priesthood, ceased when the new covenant arrived (Gen 17:13; Lev 6:18; 2 Cor 3:11). Armstrong’s notion of a separate Sabbath covenant arises from a desire to preserve the Sabbath, but Scripture never distinguishes it from the rest of the law.

Some in the Churches of God respond that if the covenant sign was for Israel, then Gentile believers must become “Israel” to receive salvation. They cite passages such as Romans 11, where Paul compares Israel to an olive tree and Gentiles to wild branches grafted in, or Ephesians 2, which speaks of being brought near to the *“commonwealth of Israel.”* From these texts they conclude that Gentiles must adopt Israel’s covenant—including the Sabbath—to remain in the tree.  

This interpretation misunderstands Paul’s metaphors. In Romans 11 Paul warns Gentile believers not to boast against unbelieving Jews; he reminds them that they share in the nourishing root, not the branches, and that continuing in God’s kindness is by faith, not by law (Rom 11:17–22). He does not instruct them to keep Israel’s calendar; he exhorts humility and perseverance in faith.  

Ephesians 2 explains that Gentiles were once *“strangers to the covenants of promise”* but have been brought near by the blood of Christ (Eph 2:12–13). Christ *“made both one,”* creating *“one new man from the two”* and breaking down *“the dividing wall of hostility”* by abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments contained in ordinances (Eph 2:14–15). Believers are united to the people of God not by taking on old covenant rituals but by sharing the faith of Abraham. Paul declares that those who are of faith are sons of Abraham (Gal 3:7) and that there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for all are one in Christ Jesus (Gal 3:28). If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed and heirs according to promise (Gal 3:29).  

Our grafting into the olive tree does not resurrect the Sinai sign; it unites us to the promise given to Abraham centuries before the law.

## The New Covenant Sign

In the new covenant the sign is not a day but a Person. Jesus said that the cup and the bread of the Lord’s Supper represent *“the new covenant in My blood”* (Luke 22:20). Paul writes that God has sealed us with His Holy Spirit as a guarantee (2 Cor 1:22; Eph 1:13). Faith in Christ, expressed in baptism and the Lord’s Table, is the outward sign of belonging to the new covenant.

Instead of clinging to an obsolete sign, the Sabbath now points beyond itself. It foreshadowed the true *“rest that remains”* and redemption found in Christ. There remains a rhythm of work and worship that wise believers may embrace, but the covenantal sign has served its purpose and given way to the reality. What counts now is resting our faith and hearts in Jesus, who tore the veil and opened the way for us to enter God’s presence and rest every day.

## Paul’s Missionary Custom and Early Christian Practice

Armstrong also emphasized that the apostles continued to attend synagogue services after the resurrection. He notes that Paul *“went in unto them, and three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures”* and counts eighty-four Sabbaths Paul allegedly kept to prove that Sabbath-keeping continued under the new covenant.  

Let us give credit where it is due: Paul did enter synagogues on the Sabbath. Why? Luke explains that it was his practice to preach *“to the Jew first and also to the Greek”* (Rom 1:16). The synagogue was where he could find his primary audience. Acts 17:2–3 records that Paul went into the synagogue *“as was his custom”* and *“explained and demonstrated that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead.”* In Acts 13:14–44, after preaching in the synagogue on the Sabbath, he is invited to speak again the following week.  

These passages reveal Paul’s missionary strategy, not a binding observance. Paul himself says he became *“to those under the law, as under the law”* in order to win those under the law (1 Cor 9:20). His synagogue visits were evangelistic, not liturgical.

The book of Acts also records believers gathering on the first day of the week. At Troas, *“on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul, ready to depart the next day, spoke to them”* (Acts 20:7). Paul instructed the Corinthians to set aside their contributions *“on the first day of the week”* (1 Cor 16:2).  

These references do not establish a mandatory Sunday observance any more than Acts 17:2 mandates Sabbath-keeping; they simply show the freedom of the early church to meet when convenient.

These historical observations raise an important question: do Paul’s Sabbath visits mean he expected Gentile believers to keep the old covenant sign? Luke’s narrative shows Paul adapting to Jewish audiences, not prescribing a universal pattern. To answer the question definitively we must examine Paul’s teaching on days and rituals in his epistles. Having looked at his missionary strategy, we now turn to his explicit instructions.

## Colossians 2:16–17 — A Foreshadow, Not a Command

Paul, a devout Jew, nevertheless warns against judging or being judged over Sabbaths. He tells the Colossians:  

> *“So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.”*  
> — Colossians 2:16–17 (NKJV)  

Armstrongians counter that this cannot abolish holy days because Paul uses present-tense verbs and the phrase *“body of Christ.”* They argue that if the annual festivals are shadows then the weekly Sabbath must also be a shadow, and since the weekly Sabbath remains, so do the festivals. Others insist that the church (*“the body of Christ”*) should judge how its members keep these days. Do these arguments hold up under close examination?

The Greek of Colossians 2:16–17 clarifies Paul’s intent. The passage appears in a warning against human regulations and asceticism (Col 2:20–23). Paul writes: **Μὴ οὖν τις ὑμᾶς κρινέτω** — *“Therefore let no one judge you.”* This is not permission for the church to judge but a prohibition against anyone sitting in judgment over matters of food, drink and sacred times.  

The triad of ἑορτή (*heortē, festival*), νουμηνία (*noumēnia, new moon*) and σαββάτων (*sabbatōn, Sabbaths*) is a standard summary of the Jewish calendar. All three are plural, indicating that Paul has in mind yearly, monthly and weekly observances. By grouping them he removes any basis for treating one category differently from the others. If the weekly Sabbath remains binding, so do the annual festivals; if the festivals are shadows, so is the weekly Sabbath.

Next, the clause ἅ ἐστιν σκιὰ τῶν μελλόντων — *“which are a shadow of things to come”* — describes the function of these days, not their duration. Greek often uses the present tense in a general or proverbial sense—the “gnomic present.” Hebrews 10:1 employs identical grammar to say that the law *“has a shadow of the good things to come,”* yet the writer simultaneously declares that the sacrificial system has been superseded by Christ.  

The festivals and Sabbaths were types, foreshadows, pointing toward Christ; now that the **σῶμα (sōma, body or substance)** has come, the **σκιά (skia, shadow)** no longer dictates practice. Armstrong’s emphasis on the word *“are”* misses this idiomatic use.

Moreover, the phrase **τὸ δὲ σῶμα τοῦ Χριστοῦ** lacks an explicit verb. Many translations supply *“is,”* yielding *“but the substance belongs to Christ.”* Armstrong’s teachers supply a different verb: *“but [let] the body of Christ [judge you].”* This reading imports words not in the text. In koine Greek, contrasts between *skia* (shadow) and *sōma* (body) were common metaphors for picture versus reality. Paul’s contrast therefore means that the food laws and days are shadows, but the reality—the substance—is found in Christ. Interpreting *“body”* as the church contradicts Paul’s repeated warnings against human judgementalism in this passage (Col 2:18, 23).

---

## Paul’s Broader Teaching Reinforces Liberty

In Romans 14 he affirms:  

> *“One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord.”*  
> — Romans 14:5–6  

The Churches of God often respond that this passage refers only to optional fasting days and not the weekly Sabbath. They argue that Paul would never equate God’s holy day with *“one day”* being esteemed above another. However, Paul’s language is broad; he uses the general term *“one day”* without qualification.  

The verbs translated *“esteems”* and *“observes”* come from the Greek roots **krinō** (to judge or regard) and **phroneō** (to set one’s mind), indicating personal evaluation rather than ascetic fasting. Paul’s point is that differences over days should not divide the church. He allows each person to be fully convinced in his own mind and cautions the strong not to despise the weak. He nowhere restricts the principle to minor fasts.  

In Galatians 4:9–11 he expresses alarm that Gentiles were *“observing days and months and seasons and years,”* calling such observance a return to slavery. Colossians 2 fits within this ethos of freedom: the old calendar served as a foreshadow of Christ’s work; believers now rest in the reality of those shadows, the Almighty Christ.

## Conclusion: The True Rest in Christ

When Jesus inaugurated the new covenant and tore the temple veil, He closed the book on a legal system that was designed for a specific people, time and purpose. Armstrong was right that the Sabbath predates Sinai and that Israel’s identity was tied to it. He was wrong, however, to detach the Sabbath from the covenant in which it served as a sign.  

The old covenant has been fulfilled; its sign has served its purpose. Christians may certainly enjoy the rest and rhythm of a weekly Sabbath, just as they may celebrate Israel’s festivals to appreciate God’s redemptive plan. But these observances are no longer covenant obligations.  

Instead:  

> *“There remains a sabbath-rest for the people of God.”*  
> — Hebrews 4:9  
 
In conclusion, the writer of Hebrews is not pointing us back to Sinai, but forward into something far greater — the *katapausis*, the deep rest of God Himself. This word does not merely mean “stopping,” as though the goal were simply ceasing activity. It means **refreshment, satisfaction, a settled peace.** God used it in Exodus 33:14 when He promised His presence to Moses: *“My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest [katapauseō].”* It is the same word Stephen quotes in Acts 7:49 when God says, *“What is the place of My rest [katapauseōs]?”* This is no mere pause from labor. This is God’s own delighted rest, the joy He felt at creation when He looked at His finished work and declared, *“It is very good.”*  

And that is precisely what Hebrews sets before us. Israel had the Sabbath day, they had the land of Canaan, they had rituals and ordinances. Yet Hebrews says they still did not enter God’s rest because of unbelief (Heb 3:19). Joshua could not give it, and David was still urging the people centuries later: *“Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts”* (Heb 4:7). The rest that remained was never tied to a calendar day. It was always tied to faith.  

That is why Hebrews 4:9 uses a unique word, **sabbatismos** — “a Sabbath-rest that remains.” It does not say the seventh day continues as the covenant sign. It says that the true rest — the magnified Sabbath — is still open, still available, still waiting for all who will believe. This rest that remains is entered not by observing a prohibition of labor one day a week, but by ceasing from the restless striving of our own works and trusting fully in Christ’s finished work.  

> *“For the one who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.”* (Heb 4:10)  

Here is the gospel in one verse. God rested from His work because it was complete and satisfying. Christ rested from His work when He cried, *“It is finished”* (John 19:30). And we enter that same rest when we finally stop trying to make ourselves righteous and place our faith entirely in the Son of God. Just as God delighted in His creation, we now delight in His new creation — the salvation accomplished in Jesus Christ.  

This is why the Sabbath command, with all its prohibitions and penalties, was only a shadow. The true **katapausis** and the true **sabbatismos** are not bound to a calendar but are found in Christ Himself. The weekly Sabbath may still be enjoyed as a rhythm of rest and worship — but it no longer defines covenant membership, nor carries the threat of death for working. Its role as a legal sign has ended.  

So the good news of Hebrews 3 and 4 is this: the door into God’s own rest is still wide open. It is not locked to one day out of seven. It is unlocked to faith. *“Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”* Today, any day, every day, we may step into the very rest of God by trusting in His Son.  

Therefore the Sabbath finds its true completion not in outwardly refraining from labor, but in inwardly resting every day in the finished work of Christ. To cling only to the shadow is to miss the substance. To insist on the sign is to overlook the reality. But to believe in Jesus is to finally taste what the Sabbath always pointed toward — the refreshing, satisfying, eternal rest of God Himself.
