# What “Be Ye Perfect; Be Ye Holy” Means: Are You Satisfied with the Works of Jesus?  

When Jesus said, *“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect”* (Matt 5:48), and when Peter echoed, *“Be holy, for I am holy”* (1 Pet 1:16), they were not commanding us to achieve sinless performance by our own efforts. They were inviting us into God’s own perfection and holiness through Jesus Christ. The real question is this: **are you satisfied with His works?**

## Resting in Another’s Handiwork  

We rely on the work of others every day. You live in a home you did not build. You drive a car you did not design. You sit in a chair you did not fashion. You rest in someone else’s handiwork all the time.  

But what about the greatest work of all—the work of Christ? He lived without sin. He bore our guilt. He shed His blood. And from the cross He declared, *“It is finished!”* (John 19:30). His work leaves no room for ours.  

Scripture says plainly:  

- *“By the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.”* (Gal 2:16)  
- *“Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us.”* (Titus 3:5)  
- *“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.”* (Eph 2:8–9)  

To rest in Jesus Christ is to finally lay down the burden of trying to make ourselves righteous and trust wholly in His finished work.

## The Rest God Promises  

The Bible speaks again and again of this rest:  

- *“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”* (Matt 11:28)  
- *“For we who have believed do enter that rest.”* (Heb 4:3)  
- *“There remains therefore a rest [sabbatismos] for the people of God.”* (Heb 4:9)  
- *“For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.”* (Heb 4:10)  

God rested at creation because His work was finished and “very good” (Gen 2:2, 31). Christ rested when His redemptive work was complete (John 19:30). We rest when we stop striving to earn holiness and believe in Him.

## A Mini-Study: The Soul and the Spirit  

Understanding the difference between *soul* and *spirit* makes this even clearer.  

**The soul (Hebrew *nephesh*, Greek *psuchē*)** is the whole living being. Man *is* a soul; he does not *have* one.  
- *“The LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”* (Gen 2:7)  
- *“The soul who sins shall die.”* (Ezek 18:4)  

**The spirit (Hebrew *ruach*, Greek *pneuma*)** is different. It is the God-given power that lifts man above the animals, giving conscience, memory, reasoning, and awareness of God.  
- *“The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD.”* (Prov 20:27)  
- *“The spirit will return to God who gave it.”* (Eccl 12:7)  

Think of the body as hardware, the brain as circuitry, and the spirit as the storage device—the “floppy disk” holding every detail of who you are. When you die, God holds that spirit, ready to “upload” it into the new body at the resurrection:  
- *“It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.”* (1 Cor 15:44)  

At that moment, we will be fully spirit, bearing the image of Christ (1 Cor 15:49).

## True Satisfaction for the Soul  

Your soul longs for satisfaction but never finds it through your works. Your spirit bears witness that you fall short, recording every thought, word, and deed. But Christ’s works answer both needs.  

Your soul can rest, because His work is finished. Your spirit can be at peace, because He has paid the debt and will raise you incorruptible.  

This is why Jesus said:  
*“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.”* (Matt 11:28–29)  

He did not say, “Work harder and be holy.” He said, “Rest in Me and find holiness.”

## Conclusion: Be Perfect in Christ  

To “be perfect” and “be holy” means to be satisfied with the work of Jesus Christ. Holiness is not something you build; it is something you receive. Perfection is not achieved; it is given. Rest is not earned; it is entered by faith.  

So the question is personal: **are you satisfied with the works of Jesus?**  

If you are, then you have found the true *sabbatismos*, the rest that remains for the people of God. And if not, then hear His voice today: *“Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts”* (Heb 4:7).  

Today, you can cease from your own works and rest in His finished work—forever.
